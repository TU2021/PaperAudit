    "explanation": {
      "strength": "Both reviews clearly agree on the core motivation and contributions. They both highlight: (1) SuRe as a surprise‑prioritised replay method using high NLL sequences to address catastrophic forgetting and improve sampling efficiency; (2) the dual fast/slow learner with LoRA adapters and EMA as a consolidation mechanism; (3) the theoretical framing of catastrophic forgetting into selection and integration errors and its role in motivating the method; (4) strong empirical performance, particularly in large task sequences / LNT settings, and robustness under small buffers and low replay ratios; and (5) generally clear evaluation with meaningful ablations and comparisons to several strong baselines. The AI review goes into more technical and procedural detail (equations, IPM bound, EMA equations, ablation tables), but the conceptual strengths and emphasis are well aligned with the human review.",
      "weakness": "The overlap on weaknesses is noticeably lower. The human review focuses on: limited novelty of the dual‑learner idea; concerns about the surprise metric’s sensitivity to outliers and hallucinations; missing comparisons to specific recent replay baselines (InfoRS, MIR); limited demonstration on more general LLM tasks beyond text classification; lack of clarity/specificity in the variance reduction theory (Lemma 2); and the need for more detailed comparisons under strict memory budgets. The AI review instead emphasises: an internal theoretical inconsistency in the EMA variance scaling; overbroad SOTA claims relative to methods requiring task identity; incomplete Algorithm 1 harming reproducibility; unquantified compute overhead of surprise scoring; reliance on known task boundaries; lack of statistical significance tests; and only heuristic/theoretical support that SuRe reduces the IPM selection term. The only partially overlapping item is a shared sense that the theoretical treatment of variance/integration error is not fully convincing or clear, but even there the AI review is much more specific about a concrete inconsistency, whereas the human review comments more generally on clarity and rigor. Overall, the two reviews flag different primary weaknesses and concerns.",
      "overall": "In aggregate, both reviews convey a similar high‑level judgment: SuRe is a practically useful, empirically strong method combining surprise‑based replay with dual learners, backed by a selection/integration theoretical framing, but with some theoretical and methodological caveats. They strongly align on what the paper is about and why it is interesting, and they both see the empirical evidence and decomposition framework as key contributions. However, they diverge more on what they consider the main limitations: the human reviewer stresses novelty, breadth of baselines, and generalisation to broader LLM tasks, while the AI review stresses internal theoretical consistency, claim qualification, algorithmic completeness, and overhead/assumption details. This leads to high alignment on strengths, moderate‑to‑low alignment on weaknesses, and a moderate overall alignment in substance and focus."

        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews agree on the core motivation (catastrophic forgetting in CL for LLMs) and central contributions: a surprise-based replay policy using NLL, and a dual fast/slow learner with EMA over LoRA adapters. They also overlap on key strengths: a unifying theoretical framework decomposing forgetting into selection/integration terms, strong empirical performance across CL benchmarks, and sample efficiency with small buffers and low replay ratios. The AI review adds more detail (architecture-agnostic design, extensive ablations, extensions beyond classification), but these largely elaborate points already present in Review A rather than shifting the emphasis.",
          "weakness": "There is partial but less complete alignment on weaknesses. Both note limited novelty in core components (dual-learner/EMA and prioritized replay are not new and need clearer added value) and theory–practice gaps (bounds and variance reduction not tightly validated empirically). However, Review A emphasizes missing baselines, limited evaluation beyond text classification and LLM generalization, vulnerability of the surprise metric to outliers/hallucinations, and clarity of Lemma 2 and memory-budget comparisons, while Review B focuses more on SOTA overclaiming, dataset/task inconsistencies, missing efficiency/runtime reporting, assumptions about known task boundaries and per-task quotas, incomplete algorithm description, lack of code, and weak statistical reporting. Overlap exists at a high level (comparability/coverage and theoretical justification), but many specific concerns are one-sided.",
          "overall": "In overall judgment and focus, the reviews are largely consistent: they see the same method, framing, and empirical story, view the work as a solid and technically interesting contribution with meaningful empirical gains, and both temper enthusiasm due to questions around novelty/positioning and some missing validations or comparisons. The AI review is more exhaustive and surfaces additional reproducibility and reporting issues, while the human review concentrates on method-level novelty, metric robustness, and baseline/task coverage, leading to high but not perfect substantive alignment."

The AI review adds more detail (e.g., forgetting metrics, explicit buffer policy, generative/Llama extensions), while the human review keeps these as broader points, but the main perceived strengths clearly overlap.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews question aspects of the theory-practice connection, especially the variance reduction/dual-learner analysis (Lemma 2/EMA scaling) and, more broadly, how well the surprise criterion/theoretical decomposition are justified empirically. They also share concerns about the breadth of CL evaluation (scope/generalization to full LLM settings and fairness of SOTA claims), but diverge in many areas: the human review flags limited novelty of the dual learner, hallucination/outlier risks, and missing specific baselines and memory-budget comparisons, whereas the AI review instead focuses heavily on reporting inconsistencies, SOTA framing, missing code, statistical rigor, and task/order documentation.",
          "overall": "Substantively, both reviews see the work as a valuable CL method with meaningful theoretical framing and solid empirical performance, but with nontrivial caveats about validation and positioning, so their high-level judgment is broadly consistent. However, the AI review introduces many additional methodological and reporting critiques that the human review does not mention, while the human review raises some conceptual/novelty concerns absent from the AI review, leading to only partial alignment on weaknesses despite strong agreement on the main contributions."
