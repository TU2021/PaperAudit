          "weakness": "The reviews show very low alignment on weaknesses, with their only overlap being a general concern about the theoretical justification for the dual-learner, where Review B identifies a specific contradiction missed by Review A. Review B focuses on concrete issues like an overstated claim and incomplete algorithm, while Review A critiques broader aspects like novelty and generalization to different tasks.",
          "overall": "The reviews align very strongly on the paper's contributions and strengths but diverge significantly on its weaknesses, leading to a moderate overall match. Review A provides high-level critiques on novelty and scope, whereas Review B acts more as a fact-checker, identifying specific inconsistencies and missing details within the paper."

While both appreciate the core idea, Review A sees a solid contribution with standard limitations, whereas Review B uncovers numerous serious execution and reporting flaws that imply a different judgment on the paper's scientific quality."
