          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions: the novel predictive module (PredNext) for SNNs, its plug-and-play design, and the consistent empirical improvements shown in high-quality experiments. They share a near-identical view of the paper's primary strengths.",
          "weakness": "There is overlap on the lack of sensitivity analysis for the loss weight (alpha) and general clarity/notational issues, but they also raise distinct major concerns. Review A focuses on limited long-range temporal modeling, while Review B highlights misleading claims about ImageNet pre-training and critical internal inconsistencies that harm reproducibility.",
          "overall": "The reviews show strong alignment on the paper's strengths and its overall positive contribution to the SNN community, but they diverge on the specific primary weaknesses. While both find flaws, Review A focuses more on performance limitations, whereas Review B is more concerned with reproducibility issues and the framing of experimental results."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core strengths as the novel temporal prediction module, strong empirical performance on large datasets, and the modular plug-and-play design. Review B is more detailed, but the main positive points and their prioritization are highly consistent with Review A.",
          "weakness": "There is overlap on weaknesses like the lack of computational overhead analysis, limited long-range modeling, and insufficient SNN-specific context/baselines. However, Review B identifies several additional major weaknesses, including limited novelty, unfair evaluation settings, and lack of statistical rigor, which are absent in Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews align well on the paper's contributions and strengths, but diverge on the depth and breadth of its weaknesses. Review B's critique is far more comprehensive, leading to a more critical overall judgment compared to Review A, resulting in a moderate overall alignment."

Review B is more detailed, but the key points and priorities are highly aligned.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the lack of analysis on computational overhead, issues with long-range modeling, and missing analysis of the loss weighting parameter. However, Review B raises many additional major concerns missed by Review A, such as the lack of statistical rigor, insufficient SNN-specific details, overclaiming of results, and missing standard evaluations like linear probing.",
          "overall": "The reviews align very well on the paper's strengths and core ideas, but diverge significantly in their assessment of its weaknesses and methodological rigor. While they agree on a few limitations, Review B presents a much more comprehensive and critical analysis, identifying numerous major issues that Review A overlooks, leading to only a moderate overall alignment in judgment."
