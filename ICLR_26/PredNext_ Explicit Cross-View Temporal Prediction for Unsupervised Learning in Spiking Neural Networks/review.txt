### Summary

The paper **PredNext** introduces a novel module for **self-supervised learning (SSL)** in **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**, focusing on temporal video data. The core innovation is the use of **Step Prediction** and **Clip Prediction**, which enhance the network¡¯s ability to learn long-range temporal dependencies. This method can be integrated with various SSL methods, such as **SimCLR**, **MoCo**, **SimSiam**, **BYOL**, and **Barlow Twins**. The authors benchmark the model on several large video datasets (UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics), demonstrating significant performance improvements, even reaching performance comparable to supervised models pretrained on **ImageNet**. The authors argue that their method achieves better temporal consistency without over-smoothing, a key issue in prior SSL approaches.

### Strengths

1. **Novel Approach for Temporal Prediction in SNNs**:

   * The introduction of **Step Prediction** and **Clip Prediction** tasks allows SNNs to model temporal relationships more effectively, surpassing traditional methods that focus solely on spatial features.
2. **High-Quality Experiments**:

   * The paper presents thorough **experiments** across multiple **large-scale video benchmarks**, and the results consistently show that **PredNext** enhances both **classification** and **retrieval** performance compared to baseline methods.
3. **Integration with Existing SSL Frameworks**:

   * **PredNext** is designed as a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated into existing SSL frameworks, making it an accessible solution for researchers working with SNNs in temporal data processing.
4. **Practical Contribution**:

   * The paper provides valuable baselines for **unsupervised SNNs**, particularly in **video data**, bridging the gap between spiking and traditional deep learning methods.

### Weaknesses

1. **Limited Long-Range Temporal Modeling**:

   * **PredNext** primarily improves **short-term temporal smoothness**, but its ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies remains limited. Performance drops significantly when predictions go beyond a single step.

2. **Lack of Analysis on Loss Weight Sensitivity**:

   * The **¦Á (alpha)** value, which controls the balance between self-supervised and predictive losses, significantly impacts model performance. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of how different values of **¦Á** affect stability and generalization.

3. **Omission of SNN-Native Baselines**:

   * The paper compares **PredNext** with standard **ANN-based** SSL methods but excludes biologically inspired **SNN-native methods** (e.g., **STDP-based** learning), which makes it difficult to assess the true advantage of **PredNext** for spiking systems.

4. **Increased Computational Overhead**:

   * The additional **prediction heads** in **PredNext** add computational complexity. The paper does not provide a clear analysis of how this impacts **scalability** and the **memory footprint** during training.

5. **Inconsistent Notation**:

   * There are **symbol inconsistencies** in the manuscript, particularly regarding the use of **T** and **N**, which can cause confusion for readers.
