          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core contribution as a practical two-stage method using a doubly robust (DR) estimator for an important SSL problem, and they agree that its main strengths are its strong theoretical guarantees and consistent empirical improvements.",
          "weakness": "The reviews show low alignment on weaknesses, with only minor overlap on the need for more baselines and concerns about theoretical assumptions. Review A focuses on high-level conceptual flaws like limited novelty and the fragility of the core label-shift assumption, while Review B focuses on specific technical and presentation issues like a theory-practice gap in sample splitting and an incorrect equation.",
          "overall": "There is strong consensus on the paper's strengths but significant divergence on its weaknesses, leading to a moderate overall alignment. While both see a valid contribution, Review A questions its fundamental novelty and assumptions more deeply, whereas Review B's critiques are more focused on technical and presentational polish."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: tackling an important problem (class distribution mismatch), using a theoretically sound doubly robust (DR) estimator, and proposing a practical two-stage framework. Review B provides more specific details, such as the unification of prior methods, but these align with and elaborate on the high-level points made by Review A.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews highlight nearly identical primary weaknesses, including the strong and untested label-shift assumption, the gap between theoretical requirements and the experiments, and the limited comparison to recent baselines. Review A also notes the limited novelty and computational cost, which are also echoed in Review B.",
          "overall": "The reviews show very high substantive alignment, agreeing that the paper presents a theoretically principled method for an important problem but has significant limitations regarding its assumptions and empirical validation. Both converge on a judgment of a solid, incremental contribution whose practical impact is not fully demonstrated, with differences primarily in granularity rather than substance."

Both converge on the judgment that the paper presents a theoretically sound method whose practical impact is limited by strong assumptions and an incomplete evaluation, with Review B simply offering a more detailed and evidenced version of Review A's assessment."
