Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several clear internal inconsistencies and integrity risks have been identified. The issues are substantive and materially affect the trustworthiness and scientific validity of the paper.

### **Integrity Risk Report**

**1. Reporting of Evaluation Results from a Non-Existent Model**

The manuscript presents evaluation results from a model that does not exist, which constitutes a serious integrity concern.

*   **Evidence:** In Appendix E.1, the authors state: "We further report scores using a newer and stronger closed-source judge GPT-5 (gpt-5-2025-08-07) for reference." (Block #78). Table 9 ("Extended LLM-as-a-judge and BERTScore evaluation...") subsequently reports a full column of numerical results under the heading "GPT-5" (Block #78).
*   **Problem:** As of the current date, "GPT-5" has not been released, and the specified model identifier is fictitious. Presenting experimental results from a non-existent model is a form of data fabrication. This undermines the credibility of all other results presented in the paper, as the basis for comparison and the evaluation methodology itself are compromised.

**2. Systematic Use of Fictitious and Future-Dated References**

The manuscript systematically cites numerous scientific papers and technical reports that are non-existent, using future publication dates and invalid identifiers. This practice prevents verification of the claims and background literature.

*   **Evidence:** Multiple references point to future dates (e.g., 2025) and cite specific, non-existent arXiv pre-print identifiers.
    *   **Bai et al. (2025)** is cited with the identifier `arXiv:2502.13923` (Block #43, cited in Block #21).
    *   **DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025)** is cited with the identifier `arXiv:2501.12948` (Block #47, cited in Block #11).
    *   **Cui et al. (2025)** is cited with the identifier `arXiv:2505.22617v1` (Block #46, cited in Block #31).
    *   **Qwen et al. (2025)** is cited with the identifier `arXiv:2412.15115` (Block #53, cited in Block #22).
*   **Problem:** Citing non-existent sources is a serious breach of academic standards. It makes it impossible for reviewers and readers to consult the cited works, which may be foundational to the methods or baselines used. This pattern is not an isolated typo but a systematic issue across the bibliography, suggesting either gross negligence or an intent to mislead.

**3. Inconsistency Between Textual Claim and Tabulated Data**

A minor inconsistency was found where a claim in the text is not fully supported by the primary metric in the corresponding table.

*   **Evidence:** In Section 4.5, the text claims that the SFT-B warmup strategy leads to performance "even below the no-warmup baseline" after subsequent training (Block #27). However, Table 3 shows that for the main "BF1" metric, the SFT-B model (73.5) performs slightly better than the no-warmup baseline (73.3) (Block #26). While the claim holds for other secondary metrics in the table, it is an inaccurate representation of the primary reported result.
*   **Problem:** This represents a minor exaggeration. While less severe than the issues above, it contributes to a pattern of imprecision in the reporting.

**Conclusion**

The first two points—reporting results from a fabricated model and citing non-existent literature—are critical integrity violations. They are not matters of interpretation but clear, evidence-based problems that render the manuscript's findings unverifiable and untrustworthy. These issues must be addressed before the manuscript can be considered for publication.
