          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the innovative explain-then-detect framework (ExPO-HM), strong empirical results across multiple datasets, and a comprehensive evaluation. Review B provides more specific details on the evaluation of reasoning and calibration, but the main positive points are highly aligned.",
          "weakness": "The reviews show very low alignment on weaknesses, with the only overlap being a concern about the manual creation of policy manuals. Review A lists potential concerns that it considers resolved by the authors, while Review B identifies multiple major, unaddressed technical limitations, such as a missing reward formula and a lack of statistical significance testing.",
          "overall": "The reviews align strongly on the paper's strengths and positive overall judgment, but diverge significantly in their critique. Review A presents a high-level positive assessment with resolved concerns, whereas Review B provides a much deeper technical critique, highlighting several major unresolved weaknesses absent from Review A, resulting in only moderate substantive alignment."

Review B provides more granular detail on specific components like CDE and calibration, but these points are encompassed within the broader strengths highlighted by Review A, resulting in very high alignment.",
          "weakness": "There is almost no alignment on weaknesses, as Review A frames all potential concerns as having been successfully addressed by the authors, while Review B presents a long list of significant, unaddressed flaws. While both mention LLM-as-a-judge, their judgments are contradictory, and Review B introduces numerous major critiques (fairness, CDE design, reproducibility) that are entirely absent from Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews show low overall alignment due to a stark divergence in their assessment of the paper's weaknesses, despite agreeing on its strengths. Review A portrays a polished, near-flawless paper, whereas Review B identifies substantial technical, ethical, and methodological gaps. This fundamental difference in critical judgment and focus leads to very different overall evaluations of the paper's quality."
