### Summary

The paper investigates the **scaling laws of uncertainty** in **deep learning**, specifically addressing how different measures of predictive uncertainty, such as epistemic uncertainty (EU), aleatoric uncertainty (AU), and total uncertainty (TU), scale with **dataset size** and **model size**. The authors aim to uncover whether these uncertainties follow power-law relationships, similar to scaling laws observed for model performance. They demonstrate that **epistemic uncertainty** and **aleatoric uncertainty** follow power-law trends with respect to dataset and model size. The work provides empirical evidence that challenges the skepticism surrounding **Bayesian methods** in deep learning, showing that **large datasets** are not always sufficient to reduce **epistemic uncertainty**, thereby emphasizing the need for Bayesian approaches.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Theoretical Depth**:

   * The theoretical exploration of why the proposed scaling laws work, especially in the context of **Bayesian deep learning**, is underdeveloped. The paper could benefit from a more **rigorous theoretical analysis**, particularly regarding the connection between **scaling laws** and **generalization error** in **singular learning theory**.

2. **Discrepancies in Uncertainty Quantification Techniques**:

   * Different uncertainty quantification techniques yield **differing results** in terms of uncertainty values and scaling trends, raising concerns about the **generalizability** of the results. The authors should discuss these inconsistencies in greater detail and explore how different techniques affect the scaling laws.

3. **Limited Scope of Experiments**:

   * While the experiments are thorough, the **dataset and model sizes** considered are somewhat limited. The paper does not capture a wide range of commonly used **model configurations** or **data regimes** seen in real-world deep learning tasks. Expanding the scope could strengthen the paper’s contribution.

4. **Missing Connections to PAC-Bayes Literature**:

   * The paper does not adequately relate its findings to the **PAC-Bayes literature**, where similar scaling behavior for **epistemic uncertainty** has already been established. The authors should discuss how their work builds upon or differs from existing **PAC-Bayes** theory and whether their findings add new insights.

5. **Clarity in Experimental Results**:

   * The experimental section lacks a **systematic analysis** of the results. It reads more like a sequence of figures with setups rather than providing deeper insights or interpretations of the findings. This could make it harder for readers to extract meaningful conclusions from the experiments.
