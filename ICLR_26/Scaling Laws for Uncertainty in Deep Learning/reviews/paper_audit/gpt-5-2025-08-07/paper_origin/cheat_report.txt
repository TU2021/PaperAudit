Summary of high-impact issues

1) Systematic inconsistency in the definition and sign of scaling exponents γ
- Evidence: Multiple figure captions state that uncertainties “follow a power-law decay of the form 1/N^{γ}” (Section 4.1.1, Figure 2 caption in Block #14), yet the reported γ values are negative while the plotted trends clearly decrease with N. Examples:
  - Figure 1 (Introduction; Block #3/4): Epistemic Uncertainty γ values are negative (MCMC γ = −0.44; MC Dropout γ = −0.36; Deep Ensembles γ = −0.80), while curves decrease with N. Under the stated functional form 1/N^{γ}, negative γ would imply growth with N, not decay.
  - Figure 2 (Block #14/15/19): Caption explicitly says “following a power-law decay of the form 1/N^{γ_TU}, 1/N^{γ_AU}, and 1/N^{γ_EU}”; reported γ values are negative (e.g., ResNet-18 p = 0.2: γTU = −0.51; γAU = −0.53; γEU = −0.39), but plotted mean uncertainties decrease with N.
  - Figure 5 (Block #20/26): ViT-small CIFAR-10 panel (b) shows decreasing TU/AU/EU with N while γ are negative (e.g., EU γ = −0.35), conflicting with the stated 1/N^{γ} decay form.
  - Appendix Figure 10 (Block #49) and Figure 11 (Block #51/53): negative γ are reported alongside decreasing uncertainty trends.
- Impact: The sign convention is central to the paper’s claims about “decay” and extrapolation. As written, 1/N^{γ} with γ < 0 implies increasing uncertainty with more data, contradicting the plotted behavior and textual statements about decay. The paper should either (i) redefine the functional form (e.g., Unc ∝ N^{γ} with γ < 0, or Unc ∝ 1/N^{|γ|} with γ > 0), or (ii) consistently report γ as positive decay rates. Without this correction, quantitative interpretation and extrapolation of scaling laws are unreliable.

2) Contradictory expressions for generalization error G_N (sign error)
- Evidence:
  - Main text Section 5.2 (Block #33), Eq. (10): G_N = −(1/2) log(2π e σ_true^2) − KL[p(y) || q_N(y)], i.e., G_N is the negative sum of aleatoric entropy and a KL term.
  - Appendix A.2 (Block #45), Eq. (31): G_N = H[𝓝(μ_true, σ_true^2)] + KL[𝓝(μ_true, σ_true^2) || 𝓝(μ_pred, σ_pred^2)], i.e., the positive sum of the same two terms.
  - Also, Section 5.2 Eq. (8) defines G_N = −E_{p(y)}[log q_N(y)], which is the cross-entropy and is non-negative; this aligns with Appendix Eq. (31) but contradicts the negative sign in the main text’s Eq. (10).
- Impact: This is a core theoretical link the paper uses to motivate uncertainty scaling (Sections 5.1–5.2). The sign error in Eq. (10) materially affects the interpretation of generalization error vs uncertainties and undermines the consistency of the theoretical contribution. The main text must correct Eq. (10) to match Appendix Eq. (31) (and standard cross-entropy decomposition).

3) Mis-citations and reference mismatches that affect clarity/trustworthiness
- Phi-2 vs Phi-3: Section 4.2 (Block #22) states experiments on “pre-trained Phi-2 model (Abdin et al., 2024)”. The bibliography entry (Block #37) is “Phi-3 technical report” (Abdin et al., 2024), not Phi-2. This creates confusion about which model was actually used.
- Adam optimizer year: Figure 5 caption (Block #20) cites “Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017)”, while the reference listed is 2015 (Block #38). This discrepancy is minor but recurrent and avoidable.
- Grokking citation: Section 4.2.1 (Block #24) discusses grokking but attributes it to Belkin et al. (2019). The grokking setup used is from Power et al. (2022) (also cited in Block #24), making the Belkin (2019) pointer inappropriate in context.
- Impact: These mismatches do not, by themselves, invalidate results, but they introduce ambiguity about what was actually done (Phi-2 vs Phi-3) and weaken trust in the manuscript’s rigor.

4) Missing methodological details that materially affect correctness of uncertainty estimates and scaling
- Number of stochastic passes / ensemble size for entropy-based metrics:
  - The definitions in Section 2.1 (Block #8) depend on K (number of stochastic passes or ensemble members), but K used for MC dropout/MCMC is never specified in Methods (Section 3; Block #10) or in the main experimental descriptions. Some captions mention “M” for deep ensembles (e.g., Figure 2 and Figure 13; Blocks #14 and #55–56) but K for MC dropout/MCMC predictive entropy calculations is not reported.
  - For MCMC, critical sampler hyperparameters are missing: chain length, burn-in, step size, momentum/friction parameters for SGHMC, mini-batch size, and convergence diagnostics. The brief description in Section 4.1.1 (Block #17) only states the prior choice and stochastic layers; no sampler details are provided.
- Impact: Entropy-based uncertainty estimates (TU, AU, EU) are sensitive to K and to sampler convergence. Without these details, the reported scaling exponents can vary significantly due to estimation noise, undermining reproducibility and the validity of the claimed scaling laws.

5) Ambiguity regarding use of Gaussian process functional priors in experiments
- Evidence:
  - Methods state “We consider parameter sampling with both global parameter priors and Gaussian process functional priors (Tran et al., 2022)” (Section 3; Block #10).
  - Experiments mention “In Appendix B, we also report results for MCMC after optimizing the priors according to the approach in Tran et al. (2022)” (Block #17). However, none of the MCMC figures explicitly indicate which runs use GP functional priors vs global priors, nor do captions specify prior settings beyond layer stochasticity (e.g., Figure 8 in Block #32/34 and Figure 14 in Block #57/60).
- Assessment: No direct evidence found in the manuscript that clearly distinguishes results using GP functional priors from those using global parameter priors (figures/captions do not specify). This makes it hard to assess the stated methodological variation and its impact on the scaling exponents.

Additional observations

- The paper frequently describes “decay” while some experiments show increasing EU with N (e.g., Figure 3; Block #16/18), which the authors acknowledge and attempt to explain via SAM. This is acceptable as a phenomenon, but the global “decay” language should be conditioned on the method/setting.
- Extrapolation to extremely large N (e.g., Figure 12; Block #52/54 with N up to 10B) appears to be purely extrapolative (dashed lines) without actual experiments beyond ~50K. The caption indicates extrapolation is intended, but the figure mixes real points and extrapolated lines across many orders of magnitude; clearer separation of empirical vs extrapolated points would reduce ambiguity.

Recommendations for correction

- Fix the scaling law functional form and sign convention consistently across the manuscript. If uncertainty decreases with N, either report Unc ∝ N^{γ} with γ < 0 or Unc ∝ 1/N^{γ} with γ > 0, and ensure all reported γ match the plotted trends and text (“decay”).
- Correct the sign in the generalization error decomposition in Section 5.2 (Eq. 10) to match Appendix A.2 (Eq. 31), i.e., G_N = AU + KL, not their negatives.
- Resolve the Phi-2 vs Phi-3 mismatch and correct citations (Adam year; grokking reference).
- Provide the essential experimental details needed to trust the uncertainty estimates:
  - K (number of stochastic passes) used for MC dropout and MCMC for computing TU/AU/EU (Eq. 1–3).
  - MCMC sampler hyperparameters and diagnostics; clarify which experiments used GP functional priors vs global priors.
- Clearly label extrapolated vs empirical points in extrapolation figures and state the fitting procedure (e.g., regression in log-log space, weighting, how γ and confidence intervals are obtained).

If these issues are addressed, the manuscript’s empirical narrative would be much more robust. As it stands, the exponent sign inconsistency and the generalization error sign error are substantial and require correction for scientific validity.
