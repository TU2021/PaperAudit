# Global Summary
Problem: Investigate whether predictive uncertainties in deep learning obey empirical scaling laws (power-law decay) with dataset size N and model size P, analogous to known loss scaling laws. Focus on uncertainty metrics Total (TU), Aleatoric (AU), Epistemic (EU), and their behavior for in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluations.

Approach: Empirical study across vision and language tasks using multiple uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods—MC dropout, Gaussian approximations (Laplace, variational), gradient-based MCMC (SGLD/SGHMC) with both parameter and functional priors, Deep Ensembles (M ∈ {5,10}), and partially stochastic networks. Theoretically connect TU and generalization error via Bayesian linear regression and Singular Learning Theory (SLT).

Evaluation scope:
- Vision: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-32, CIFAR-10-C/100-C OOD; architectures include ResNet, WideResNet, ViT.

Caveats and limitations:
- Predictive uncertainties did not exhibit clear scaling with model parameters P in this setup (Figure 7; specific numeric trends not provided).
- Compute-budget scaling not studied due to limited resources.
- Some results averaged over 10 folds (MC Dropout on CIFAR-10/100), while others report single-fold (WideResNet Deep Ensembles).
- For large pretrained LLMs (Phi-2), fine-tuning uncertainties saturated (γ = 0.00), limiting insight into scaling behavior on small fine-tuning data.

# Abstract
- Problem statement: Examine whether predictive uncertainties (TU, AU, EU) in deep learning follow empirical scaling laws with dataset/model size; classic parametric models exhibit O(1/N) epistemic contraction, but over-parameterized deep nets lack guarantees.
- Approach: Empirical evaluation on vision and language tasks using approximate Bayesian inference and ensemble methods; study in- and out-of-distribution uncertainty scaling.
- Key result: Predictive uncertainties scale as power-laws with N across methods and settings; reported exponents include ResNet-18 EU scaling on CIFAR-10:
  - MCMC: γ = −0.44 (N: 1K→50K)
  - MC Dropout: γ = −0.36 (N: 10K→50K)
  - Deep Ensembles: γ = −0.80 (N: 10K→50K)
- Claim: Even with large datasets, epistemic uncertainty typically does not vanish; scaling enables extrapolation to larger N/P.

# Introduction
- Context: Prior scaling laws show test loss follows power-law f(x) ∝ x^−γ with data/model/compute; double descent indicates larger models can generalize better.
- Question: Do similar power-laws govern predictive uncertainty?
- UQ background: Bayesian marginalization of weights vs point estimates; scalable approximations (Laplace, VI, MC dropout), Deep Ensembles, and gradient-based MCMC (SGLD, SGHMC).
- Metrics: Decomposition TU, AU, EU; interest in ensemble diversity (EU) and collapse regimes.
- Figure 1 quantitative: ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10) EU scaling γ values across methods:
  - MCMC: γ = −0.44 (N: 1K→50K)
  - MC Dropout: γ = −0.36 (N: 10K→50K)
  - Deep Ensembles: γ = −0.80 (N: 10K→50K)
- Contributions:
  - Empirical study across architectures, modalities, datasets; first to consider uncertainty scaling laws in deep learning.
  - Observe power-law trends for ID and OOD uncertainties; extrapolation to larger N to locate regimes where EU is negligible to a numerical precision.
  - Theoretical link between SLT generalization error and total uncertainty in linear models.
- Theoretical framing: SLT suggests generalization follows L − L0 = λ/N^γ; authors derive a formal connection between generalization and TU for linear models.

# Preliminaries
- Uncertainty Quantification definitions:
  - TU(x) = entropy of mean predictive distribution across K ensemble members (Eq. 1).
  - AU(x) = average entropy across ensemble members (Eq. 2).
  - EU(x) = TU − AU (Eq. 3).
- Evaluation metric: Mean test predictive uncertainty over N_test samples (Eq. 4); report Unc ∈ {TU, AU, EU}.
- Notes: TU decomposition additivity limitations acknowledged; ensemble collapse concerns cited.
- Scaling laws background: Test loss typically scales as L(x) = L∞ + (x0/x)^α (Eq. 5); α depends on domain; comprehensive understanding of uncertainty scaling with N/P/C remains open.

# Method
- MC Dropout: Train with dropout; test-time stochastic masks yield ensemble predictions; used as baseline.
- Gaussian Approximations: Laplace (curvature-based Gaussian around optimum) and VI (optimize KL to posterior).
- MCMC: Gradient-based samplers (SGHMC, SGLD) to sample posterior over network parameters; consider global parameter priors and Gaussian process functional priors.
- Deep Ensembles: Train multiple independent networks; ensemble sizes M ∈ {5, 10}.
- Partially stochastic networks: Infer only a subset of layers (e.g., first or first+second), others fixed to pretrained solutions.

# Experiments
- General setup: Extensive matrix across architectures (ResNet, WideResNet, ViT), datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-32, algorithmic MODULO 97, QQP, ARC), methods (MC Dropout, Deep Ensembles, MCMC, Bayesian LoRA). Systematically vary optimization, priors, stochasticity, and inference.

  - MC Dropout rates explored: p ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5}.
  - Ensembles: M ∈ {5, 10}.

# Discussion
- Identifiable parametric models (Bayesian linear regression):
  - Model: y = θᵗφ(x) + ε; ε ∼ 𝒩(0, σ²); Gaussian conjugate prior yields closed-form posterior predictive.
  - Predictive variance decomposes into AU (σ²) and EU (φ(x)ᵗS_Nφ(x)); posterior predictive variance contracts: σ²_{N+1}(x) ≤ σ²_N(x); lim_{N→∞} σ²_N(x) = σ².
  - Asymptotic TU at test point x_{N+1} (Eq. 12): TU(x_{N+1}) = (1/2) log(2πe σ_true²) + [1/(2(N+1))] x_{N+1}ᵗ Σ_{X_{N+1}}^{-1} x_{N+1} + O(1/(N+1)²); EU decays as O(1/N).

- Connection to SLT and generalization error:
  - Free energy F_N = −log p(y_N|X_N) (Eq. 7, 24); generalization error G_N measures expected change in marginal likelihood when adding a data point (Eq. 8).
  - Manipulation (Eq. 10): G_N expressed via aleatoric uncertainty term and KL divergence between true predictive p(y) and posterior predictive q_N(y); elsewhere derived: G_N = AU + KL (Eq. 31), with KL = KL[𝒩(y|μ_true, σ_true²) || 𝒩(y|μ_pred, σ_pred²)] (Eq. 33).
  - As q_N(y) → p(y), KL → 0 and G_N → (1/2) log(2πe σ_true²) (Appendix).
  - SLT asymptotics (Eq. 35–36): E_n[G_N] = λ/n − (m−1)/(n log n) + o(1/(n log n)); F_N = n S_n + λ log n − (m−1) log log n + O_p(1); λ is learning coefficient; for regular models λ = d/2, m = 1.

- Conclusions:
  - Empirical uncertainties exhibit power-law scaling across modalities, architectures, and UQ methods; theoretical insights link TU and generalization; exact γ coefficients depend on architecture/UQ/hyperparameters and are not directly predicted by current theory.
  - Practical utility: extrapolate uncertainty to large N to estimate data needed for ensemble collapse to a given precision.

- Limitations:
  - No clear scaling with model parameters P in this setup; compute-budget scaling omitted; limited capacity to test extrapolation at very large N beyond GPT-2 algorithmic task.

- Experimental setup (Appendix C):
  - ViT architecture params: patch size 4; embed dim 512; depth 6; 8 heads; MLP hidden 256; dropout in transformer/embeddings {0.1, 0.5}; implementation link provided.
  - GPT-2 (Algorithmic task) training: Max sequence length 256; embedding size 128; 2 layers; 4 heads; dropout 0.1 (residuals, embeddings, attention); AdamW lr 10⁻⁴; 100 warmup steps; 10,000 epochs; implementation link provided.

- Additional notes:
  - Some plots show single-fold results (e.g., WideResNet Deep Ensembles on CIFAR-10); others average over 10 folds (ResNet MC Dropout on CIFAR-10/100).
  - Model-parameter scaling results (Figure 7) noted but specific γ-by-P numeric values not specified in text.
