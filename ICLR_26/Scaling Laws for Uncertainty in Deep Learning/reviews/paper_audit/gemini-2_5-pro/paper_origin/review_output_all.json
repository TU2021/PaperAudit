This could involve fixing the dataset size N and training a family of models with varying P (e.g., the full range of ResNets or ViT variants).\n    *   The results should be presented in a dedicated log-log plot of uncertainty vs. P. If a clear power law does not emerge, this negative result would itself be interesting and should be discussed, perhaps hypothesizing why performance scales cleanly with P while uncertainty does not.*   **Improve Presentation and Strengthen Interpretations**\n    *   The authors should revise figure captions to be more descriptive and less like data tables. The detailed γ values could be moved to a summary table in the appendix for easier reference.\n    *   For the SAM experiment, the authors could strengthen their interpretation by including an empirical measurement that supports their hypothesis, such as the trace of the Hessian or the loss curvature along random directions, to show that SAM indeed finds flatter minima in their setting.\n    *   For the GPT-2 result in Figure 4, the authors should address the final uptick. If it is an artifact of noise (e.g., due to only 3 folds), they could increase the number of seeds. If the effect is robust, they should offer a concrete hypothesis or explicitly label it as an unexplained phenomenon requiring future work.*   **Explicitly Address the Theory-Practice Gap**\n    *   The authors should more clearly delineate the theoretical results for linear models from the empirical findings in deep networks in Section 5.\n    *   It would be beneficial to include a discussion on *why* the intuitions from the linear model might (or might not) transfer to deep learning. This could involve discussing concepts like the effective dimensionality of the data manifold or the local geometry of the loss landscape, which are central to theories like SLT.\n    *   Explicitly stating the assumptions required to bridge this gap would frame the theoretical contribution more accurately and highlight clear directions for future theoretical work.5) Score\n*   Overall (10): 8 — The paper introduces a novel and important research direction with a strong and comprehensive empirical study, though the presentation and analysis of model-size scaling could be improved.\n*   Novelty (10): 9 — This appears to be the first systematic study to establish scaling laws for predictive uncertainty in deep learning, opening a new and valuable area of inquiry.\n*   Technical Quality (10): 7 — The empirical work is extensive, but inconsistencies in experimental protocols and an inconclusive investigation into model-size scaling weaken the technical execution.\n*   Clarity (10): 7 — The paper is generally well-written, but the presentation could be improved through clearer figure captions and more rigorous interpretations of some surprising results.\n*   Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, as I have expertise in Bayesian deep learning and scaling laws, and the paper provides sufficient detail to evaluate its claims.",

This setting is fundamentally different from the over-parameterized, non-identifiable deep neural networks used in the experiments.\n    *   The paper proposes SLT as a \"speculative theoretical link\" (Section 5.2) but does not bridge the large conceptual gap between the linear model derivation and the empirical results from deep networks.\n    *   While the connection is valuable as a starting point, its explanatory power for the observed phenomena in complex models like ResNets or ViTs remains limited, and the paper could be more explicit about the assumptions that would need to hold for the theory to apply more broadly.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Unify and Clarify Experimental Protocols and Reporting**\n    *   To enable more robust comparisons, the authors should establish a single, consistent training protocol (e.g., fixed optimizer, scheduler, and epoch count) for the core set of experiments demonstrating the main scaling phenomena.\n    *   Deviations from this protocol, such as the ablations on learning rate schedulers or optimizers (e.g., Figure 3, Figure 5), should be clearly framed as such, with the baseline protocol as a reference point.\n    *   A summary table of hyperparameters for each main figure would improve reproducibility.\n    *   Ensure consistency between figure captions and visualizations. For instance, use the same clear plotting convention for multi-fold results (e.g., showing individual runs and the mean, as in Figure 10) in all relevant figures, including Figure 2(a).*   **Refine Analysis and Claims on Model Size Scaling**\n    *   A more systematic investigation of scaling with model size (P) is needed to fully address the paper's stated goals. This could involve fixing the dataset size N and training a family of models with varying P.\n    *   If a clear power law does not emerge, this negative result would itself be interesting and should be discussed.\n    *   The language in the Limitations section should be revised to accurately reflect the results in Figure 7, for example by acknowledging the existence of non-power-law trends rather than stating no trends were observed.*   **Ensure All Introductory Claims are Substantiated**\n    *   The authors must provide the full experimental details and results that produce the Deep Ensembles scaling law (γ_EU = -0.80) shown for ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 in Figure 1. If this result cannot be substantiated, it should be replaced with one that is fully documented in the paper.\n    *   To improve narrative flow, the MCMC results from Figure 1 should be integrated into the main experimental discussion in Section 4, rather than being relegated solely to the appendix.*   **Improve Presentation and Strengthen Interpretations**\n    *   The authors should revise figure captions to be more descriptive and less like data tables. The detailed γ values could be moved to a summary table in the appendix for easier reference.\n    *   For the SAM experiment, the authors could strengthen their interpretation by including an empirical measurement that supports their hypothesis, such as the trace of the Hessian or the loss curvature along random directions.\n    *   For the GPT-2 result in Figure 4, the authors should address the final uptick. If it is an artifact of noise, they could increase the number of seeds. If the effect is robust, they should offer a hypothesis or explicitly label it as an unexplained phenomenon.*   **Explicitly Address the Theory-Practice Gap**\n    *   The authors should more clearly delineate the theoretical results for linear models from the empirical findings in deep networks in Section 5.\n    *   It would be beneficial to include a discussion on *why* the intuitions from the linear model might (or might not) transfer to deep learning. This could involve discussing concepts like the effective dimensionality or the local geometry of the loss landscape.\n    *   Explicitly stating the assumptions required to bridge this gap would frame the theoretical contribution more accurately and highlight clear directions for future theoretical work.5) Score\n*   Overall (10): 7 — The paper introduces a novel and important research direction with a strong empirical study, but significant issues with unsubstantiated claims and inconsistent reporting need to be addressed.\n*   Novelty (10): 9 — This appears to be the first systematic study to establish scaling laws for predictive uncertainty in deep learning, opening a new and valuable area of inquiry.\n*   Technical Quality (10): 6 — The empirical work is extensive, but an unsubstantiated key introductory result, inconsistent experimental reporting, and an inconclusive investigation into model-size scaling weaken the technical execution.\n*   Clarity (10): 6 — The paper is generally well-written, but the presentation is undermined by dense figure captions, a disconnect between introductory claims and the main text, and inconsistent visualizations.\n*   Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, as I have expertise in Bayesian deep learning and scaling laws, and the paper provides sufficient detail to evaluate its claims."
