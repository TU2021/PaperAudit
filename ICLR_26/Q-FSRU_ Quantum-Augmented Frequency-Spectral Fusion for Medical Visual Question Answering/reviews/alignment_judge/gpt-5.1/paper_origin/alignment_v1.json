      "strength": "Both reviews describe essentially the same core idea and contributions. They agree that the paper proposes Q-FSRU, a medical VQA model that: (1) transforms both image and text features into the frequency domain via FFT, (2) fuses and enhances these spectral representations (including gating and spectral filtering), and (3) augments them with a quantum-inspired retrieval mechanism based on fidelity between quantum-like states to incorporate external medical knowledge. Both highlight the novelty of jointly using frequency-domain multimodal fusion and quantum-inspired retrieval in the Med-VQA setting, and both recognize strong empirical performance on VQA-RAD plus cross-dataset transfer to PathVQA, supported by ablation studies showing the importance of individual components (particularly FFT-based spectral processing, with additional gains from quantum retrieval and contrastive learning). They also concur that the paper’s motivation is clearly presented and that the high-level architecture is coherent and well explained. Thus, on motivations and strengths, the alignment is very high.",
      "weakness": "There is partial but not complete overlap in the weaknesses emphasized. The main common thread is that both note ambiguity or incompleteness in how the quantum / knowledge retrieval component is integrated into the final classifier and answer generation. Review A explicitly flags inconsistencies between sections describing how retrieved knowledge is used and calls for a direct ablation on knowledge embeddings; Review B repeatedly highlights contradictions between different sections about whether k_agg is included in z_concat and which features feed the retrieval module, and it questions the clarity and reproducibility of the retrieval corpus and pipeline. Both therefore share the concern that the retrieval (and especially its effect on classification) is under-specified. Review A also criticizes the limited evaluation granularity (no breakdown by question type or modality), the use of relatively small datasets, the unclear benefit attribution specifically to the ‘quantum’ aspect vs. a generic similarity kernel, the underspecified rationale for applying FFT to text features, and the lack of calibration/error analysis. In contrast, Review B focuses more heavily on internal technical inconsistencies and missing details: conflicting definitions of z_concat, inconsistent retrieval inputs, misuse/mislabeling of ‘convolution’ and missing tensor shapes, unclear loss weighting and temperature choices, lack of statistical test description and AUC protocol, incomplete description of the knowledge base, and some baseline-setup questions (LLM parameter counts/training). Those points do not appear in Review A. Conversely, Review A’s concerns about small dataset scale, modality-/question-type breakdowns, and calibration are absent from Review B. Because they align on the broad issue of unclear retrieval integration but diverge substantially on many other specific weaknesses, the weakness/error alignment is moderate rather than high.",
      "overall": "In aggregate, the two reviews convey a broadly similar judgment of the paper: both see it as a novel and promising combination of frequency-domain fusion and quantum-inspired retrieval for medical VQA, with strong empirical results and useful ablations, but both are uneasy about the clarity and substantiation of the quantum/retrieval component and its exact role in final predictions. They agree on the main contributions and the value of the FFT-based spectral approach, and they share skepticism about how well the retrieval mechanism is specified and evaluated. However, Review B goes much deeper into internal methodological consistency, implementation details, statistical reporting, and baseline fairness, raising many technical issues that Review A does not mention; Review A instead emphasizes evaluation breadth, clinical suitability (calibration, error analysis), dataset scale, and the conceptual justification for text FFT. Thus, the overall substantive focus and qualitative judgment are strongly aligned on the big picture, but the fine-grained lists of concerns differ, leading to a high—but not perfect—overall alignment."

          "strength": "Both reviews agree that the core contribution is a Med-VQA model (Q-FSRU) that integrates FFT-based frequency-domain processing with a quantum-inspired retrieval module, and they both emphasize strong empirical gains on VQA-RAD and cross-dataset transfer to PathVQA, supported by ablations. Review B adds more granular strengths (mathematical formulation, contrastive learning details, implementation clarity), but these are largely refinements of the same main strengths already captured more coarsely in Review A.",
          "weakness": "The main overlapping weakness is the ambiguity/inconsistency around how quantum/knowledge embeddings are integrated into the final classifier, and both call for a direct ablation to isolate the effect of knowledge retrieval. Review A also flags unclear generation in the RAG pipeline, justification for text frequency processing, limited dataset size, and lack of detailed error/clinical analysis, while Review B instead adds a broader set of concerns (knowledge base specification, 1D vs 2D FFT rationale, label alignment in cross-dataset evaluation, baseline/ statistical rigor, data augmentation risks, and interpretability evidence), so there is only partial overlap on weaknesses.",
          "overall": "Substantively, both reviews see the work as a novel and technically interesting fusion of spectral features with quantum-inspired retrieval that yields meaningful empirical improvements, but with important unresolved questions about the retrieval/knowledge integration and some aspects of evaluation. Review B is more exhaustive and introduces additional methodological and experimental critiques, yet its overall judgment and focus remain broadly consistent with Review A, leading to high but not perfect alignment."

          "weakness": "Both reviews highlight a key inconsistency in how retrieved knowledge/knowledge embeddings are integrated into the classifier, and they share concerns about the clarity/justification of some frequency-domain choices and about the adequacy/rigor of the evaluation setup.

This yields only partial overlap in weaknesses, with several important concerns appearing in only one review.",
          "overall": "Substantively, both reviews see the work as a novel and promising Med-VQA architecture with strong empirical results but hampered by non-trivial methodological and clarity issues, especially around the quantum retrieval pipeline. Their positive judgments are closely aligned, while their critiques overlap on some central issues but diverge in breadth and emphasis, leading to a moderately strong but not near-perfect overall alignment. The AI review can be viewed as a more exhaustive, methodologically focused extension of the human review’s main concerns rather than a contradictory assessment."
