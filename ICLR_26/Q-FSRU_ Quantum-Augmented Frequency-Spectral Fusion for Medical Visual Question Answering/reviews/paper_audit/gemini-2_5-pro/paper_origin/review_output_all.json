  "baseline_review": "1) Summary\nThis paper introduces Q-FSRU, a novel framework for Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing spatial-domain models by transforming both visual and textual features into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to capture global contextual patterns. To enhance factual grounding and reasoning, the model incorporates a Quantum-inspired Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Quantum RAG) module, which retrieves relevant medical knowledge from an external corpus using a quantum fidelity-based similarity measure. The components are integrated with a dual contrastive learning objective to improve multimodal feature alignment. Experiments conducted on the VQA-RAD dataset show that Q-FSRU achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming the positive contributions of both the frequency-domain processing and the quantum-inspired retrieval mechanism.2) Strengths\n*   **Novel and Well-Motivated Architecture**\n    *   The core contribution—combining frequency-domain analysis for multimodal features with a knowledge retrieval mechanism—is a novel approach for Med-VQA (Section 1, Figure 1). This is well-motivated by the hypothesis that spectral patterns can capture global diagnostic cues missed by purely spatial models.\n    *   The integration of a quantum-inspired retrieval mechanism, specifically using Uhlmann fidelity for similarity, is an interesting and non-trivial extension to standard retrieval-augmented models (Section 4.4). This moves beyond common cosine similarity and is grounded in established quantum-inspired information retrieval literature (Section 2.3).\n    *   The end-to-end framework, which sequentially enhances features in the frequency domain before using them to guide knowledge retrieval, represents a thoughtful and logical design (Section 4.5.1).*   **Strong and Statistically Significant Empirical Results**\n    *   The proposed Q-FSRU model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VQA-RAD benchmark, outperforming all baselines across multiple metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall, AUC) (Table 1).\n    *   The performance gains are substantial, with a +2.9% absolute improvement in accuracy over the strongest baseline, FSRU (Table 1).\n    *   The authors provide statistical significance testing (p < 0.01 for all main results), which strengthens the claims and demonstrates that the observed improvements are unlikely due to random chance (Table 1).*   **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation**\n    *   The paper includes a thorough ablation study that systematically validates the contribution of each key component of the proposed architecture (Table 3). This analysis clearly demonstrates the large impact of frequency processing (−4.9% accuracy drop when removed) and the significant, albeit smaller, benefit of the quantum retrieval module (−3.2% drop) and contrastive learning (−2.7% drop).\n    *   A cross-dataset generalization experiment is performed by training on VQA-RAD and evaluating on PathVQA (and vice-versa), showing that Q-FSRU maintains its performance advantage in a transfer learning setting (Table 2). This suggests the learned representations are robust and not overfitted to a single domain.\n    *   The selection of baselines is comprehensive, including general-purpose VQA models (MCAN, LXMERT), recent large vision-language models for medicine (LLaVA-Med, STLLaVA-Med), and methods focused on knowledge augmentation (LaPA) and frequency analysis (FSRU) (Section 6, Table 1).3) Weaknesses\n*   **Significant Clarity and Consistency Issues in the Methodology**\n    *   A critical contradiction exists in the description of the final feature fusion. Section 4.5.1 (\"Feature Integration Pipeline\") states that the retrieved knowledge embedding `k_agg` is concatenated with the frequency features for the classifier: `z_concat = [t_freq || v_freq || k_agg]`. However, Section 4.5.2 (\"Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier\") explicitly states the opposite: `z_concat = [t_freq || v_freq]`, noting that it excludes the quantum knowledge embeddings. This makes it unclear how the retrieved knowledge is actually used for the final prediction.\n    *   The text feature extraction method is underspecified and potentially simplistic. Section 4.2.1 mentions using \"domain-specific embeddings\" without naming the specific model (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioWordVec) and then applies simple mean pooling, which discards all sequential information from the question.\n    *   The \"Unimodal Spectrum Compression\" in Section 4.3.2 uses learnable filter banks that appear to compress a 256-dimensional frequency vector into just 4 dimensions. This is an extremely aggressive information bottleneck, and the paper provides no justification for this design choice or analysis of its impact.*   **Lack of Supporting Qualitative Analysis**\n    *   The paper claims that the model improves interpretability and that its components provide advantages in specific clinical scenarios (Section 1, Section 7.2.1). However, these claims are not supported with evidence.\n    *   Section 7.2.1 (\"Qualitative Analysis\") describes the benefits of the model in abstract terms but provides no concrete examples. There are no visualizations showing an input image, question, the model's answer, and the retrieved knowledge that led to that answer.\n    *   While the appendix contains visualizations of frequency spectra (Figure 2, Blocks 43-46), these are not connected to any specific model predictions or reasoning processes, failing to illustrate *how* frequency analysis helps in practice.*   **Disorganized Presentation of Figures**\n    *   The placement and referencing of figures are confusing and detract from the paper's readability. For example, the main architecture diagram (Figure 1) is shown in Block 20, but its caption is located separately in Block 17, and it is first referenced in Block 18.\n    *   Figure 2 is described in the appendix (Block 43) as showing spectrograms of an image and text, but it is never presented as a complete, unified figure. Instead, its constituent parts are scattered across separate image blocks (Blocks 44, 45, 46), making it difficult for the reader to interpret the intended visualization.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Revise and Clarify the Methodology Section**\n    *   Please resolve the contradiction regarding the use of the retrieved knowledge embedding `k_agg`. The text in Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 must be made consistent to accurately describe whether `k_agg` is part of the input to the final MLP classifier.\n    *   Please specify the exact \"domain-specific embeddings\" used for text encoding in Section 4.2.1. It would also strengthen the paper to briefly justify the choice of mean pooling or include a note on exploring more advanced text encoders as future work.\n    *   Please add a justification for the design of the \"Unimodal Spectrum Compression\" module (Section 4.3.2). A brief sensitivity analysis in the appendix showing how performance varies with the number of filter banks (e.g., 4 vs. 8 vs. 16) would be very insightful.*   **Incorporate Concrete Qualitative Examples**\n    *   Please add a dedicated subsection with 2-3 qualitative examples to substantiate the claims made in Section 7.2.1. Each example should present an image-question pair, the model's prediction, the ground truth, and, crucially, the top-k retrieved knowledge snippets from the Quantum RAG module.\n    *   It would be most effective to showcase examples where Q-FSRU succeeds while a key baseline (e.g., FSRU or a spatial-only model) fails, and then use the retrieved knowledge or a discussion of the frequency patterns to explain the performance difference.*   **Improve Figure Organization and Presentation**\n    *   Please ensure that all figures are placed physically close to their first reference in the text and that each figure's caption is placed directly beneath it. For instance, the caption in Block 17 should be moved to accompany the image in Block 20.\n    *   Please consolidate the scattered images in Blocks 44, 45, and 46 into a single, multi-panel Figure 2, as described by the caption in Block 43.
