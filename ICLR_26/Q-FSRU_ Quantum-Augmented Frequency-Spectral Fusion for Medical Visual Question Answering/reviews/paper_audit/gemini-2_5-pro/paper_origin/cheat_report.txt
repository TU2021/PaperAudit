Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several significant internal inconsistencies and integrity risks have been identified. These issues materially affect the scientific validity and trustworthiness of the work.

### Summary of Key Issues

1.  **Fundamental Contradiction in Model Architecture:** The description of the final classification step is contradictory. Section 4.5.1 and Figure 1 indicate that the retrieved knowledge is used for prediction, while Section 4.5.2 explicitly states it is excluded.
2.  **Use of Impossible or Fabricated References:** Several references cited to support the novelty of the approach have future publication dates (e.g., 2025) and corresponding non-existent or impossible arXiv identifiers.
3.  **Mismatch Between Methodology and Visualization:** The visualization of the text feature processing in the Appendix (Figure 2) does not align with the 1D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation described in the methodology.
4.  **Inconsistent Description of Experimental Scope:** The paper claims to perform comprehensive evaluations on two benchmarks (VQA-RAD and PathVQA) but only presents primary results and ablations for VQA-RAD.

### Detailed Analysis of Inconsistencies

#### 1. Contradiction Regarding the Use of Retrieved Knowledge in the Final Classifier

There is a direct contradiction in the methodology regarding whether the output of the Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Quantum RAG) component is used in the final classification layer.

*   **Claim 1 (Knowledge is Used):** Section 4.5.1, "Feature Integration Pipeline" (Block #23), states that the final concatenated feature vector for the classifier is `z_concat = [t_freq || v_freq || k_agg]`, where `k_agg` is the aggregated knowledge embedding from the quantum retrieval step.
*   **Claim 2 (Knowledge is Excluded):** Section 4.5.2, "Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier" (Block #24), explicitly states the opposite: "The fused input consists of only the frequency-enhanced text and image features concatenated, **excluding the quantum knowledge embeddings**" and redefines the input as `z_concat = [t_freq || v_freq]`.
*   **Supporting Evidence for Contradiction:**
    *   The main architecture diagram, **Figure 1 (Block #20)**, shows an arrow from the "Quantum Inspired RAG" module directly into the "Feed Forward Layer(MLP)", supporting Claim 1.
    *   The ablation study in **Table 3 (Block #34)** reports a significant accuracy drop of -3.2% when the "Quantum Retrieval" component is removed ("w/o Quantum Retrieval"). This result would be impossible if the retrieved knowledge `k_agg` was not used in the final prediction, as described in Claim 2.

**Impact:** This is a fundamental contradiction concerning a core component of the proposed model. It is unclear which version of the model was actually implemented and evaluated, undermining the paper's reproducibility and the validity of the results attributed to the quantum retrieval mechanism.

#### 2. Highly Suspicious and Potentially Fabricated References

The manuscript cites several papers with future publication dates and impossible identifiers, raising serious concerns about research integrity.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Kankeu et al. (2025) (Block #37):** Cited for "Quantum-inspired Embeddings". The reference lists a publication date of "Jan 2025" and an arXiv URL of `http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04591`. An arXiv identifier starting with "2501" would correspond to a submission in January 2025, which is in the future.
    *   **Xing (2025) (Block #38):** Cited for frequency-aware architectures. The reference lists a publication date of "may 2025" and an arXiv URL of `http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17544`. An identifier starting with "2505" is also impossible at this time.
    *   Other references, such as **Huang et al. (2025)** and **Nguyen et al. (2025)**, also list future publication dates (April 2025, August 2025).

**Impact:** The use of seemingly fabricated references to support the paper's technical foundations is a major integrity risk. It misrepresents the state of the art and creates a false impression that the proposed methods are built upon an established body of recent work.

#### 3. Inconsistency Between Described Method and Appendix Visualization

The method for processing text features is inconsistent with its visual representation.

*   **Method Description (Block #15):** Section 4.3.1 states that a **1D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** is applied to the pooled text feature vector `t`, which has a dimension of `d_model = 256`. This operation would produce a 1D spectrum of 256 values.
*   **Visualization (Block #44, Appendix Figure 2):** The figure provided to illustrate this process ("Text Data Linguistic Spectrum") is a **2D heatmap**. Its axes are labeled "Sequence Length" and "Feature Dimensions". This visualization is incompatible with the output of a 1D FFT on a single pooled vector.

**Impact:** This discrepancy suggests either a misunderstanding of the described technique or that the implemented method differs from the one described in the text. It confuses the reader and casts doubt on the technical correctness of the frequency-domain processing component.

#### 4. Overstated Experimental Scope

The scope of the experimental evaluation is described inconsistently.

*   **Claim (Block #28):** Section 5.1 states, "We conduct comprehensive evaluations on **two** established medical visual question answering benchmarks," naming VQA-RAD and PathVQA.
*   **Actual Experiments (Blocks #32, #33, #34):** The primary performance comparison (**Table 1**) and the ablation studies (**Table 3**) are conducted **only on the VQA-RAD dataset**. The PathVQA dataset is used exclusively for a cross-dataset generalization experiment (**Table 2**), not for a full, independent evaluation (i.e., training and testing).

**Impact:** While less severe than the other issues, this is a clear misrepresentation of the experimental design. The claim of "comprehensive evaluations on two... benchmarks" is not supported by the presented results.

### Conclusion

The manuscript contains multiple, high-impact internal contradictions and clear integrity risks, most notably the conflicting descriptions of the core model architecture and the use of impossible references. These issues prevent a fair and accurate assessment of the paper's scientific contribution and undermine its credibility.
