Summary
The paper proposes Q-FSRU, a medical VQA framework that fuses frequency-domain representations of image and text features (via FFT and learnable filter banks) with a quantum-inspired retrieval-augmented generation component that selects external medical knowledge using Uhlmann fidelity between normalized “quantum states.” The system integrates dual contrastive objectives and reports state-of-the-art results on VQA-RAD, along with cross-dataset evaluations on PathVQA. Ablation studies suggest the largest gains come from FFT-based processing, with additional improvements from quantum retrieval and contrastive learning.

Soundness
The overall architecture is plausible, and the FFT-based spectral processing could help highlight global patterns. However, there are several internal inconsistencies and missing details that undermine soundness. Notably, there is a contradiction in how knowledge embeddings are used for classification (Method §4.5.1 vs. §4.5.2): Step 3 includes k_agg in z_concat, whereas §4.5.2 explicitly excludes quantum knowledge from the classification head. The loss formulation also changes between §3 (“α, β” weights) and §4.5.4 (fixed 0.3/0.7 mixing), without justification. The “parameterized convolution” in §4.3.2 is written as a linear weighted sum, which is not a convolution; shapes and kernel specifics are not specified. The quantum retrieval pipeline (§4.4.3) uses t_enhanced and v_enhanced, but the integration pipeline in §4.5.1 passes t_freq and v_freq to QuantumRAG—another mismatch. For fidelity, since the states are pure (ρ=|ψ⟩⟨ψ|), the measure reduces to the squared inner product; this simplification, its numerical stability, and computational cost relative to cosine are not examined. Statistical claims (Table 1, Table 3, p-values) lack a description of the test (e.g., paired t-test across folds) and multi-class AUC computation. The knowledge corpus is not defined (size, source, curation), making retrieval impact difficult to verify.

Presentation
The paper is generally clear in motivation and high-level design, with a useful system diagram (Fig. 1) and spectrogram visualizations (Appendix, Fig. 2–3). Yet several places cause confusion: conflicting definitions of z_concat (§4.5.1 vs. §4.5.2), inconsistent inputs to retrieval (§4.4.3 vs. §4.5.1), and the use of “convolution” in §4.3.2. Some dimensions are unclear (e.g., gate matrices in §4.3.3, spectrum sizes vs. d_model, Appendix’s “Sequence Length 0–120” despite L≤50 in §5.1). Baseline parameter counts (e.g., “7000 M” for LLaVA-Med/STLLaVA-Med) are unusual without clarifying if full LLMs are counted and how they were used. The experiments section lacks a clear description of the knowledge base.

Contribution
Combining frequency-domain multimodal fusion with a quantum-inspired retrieval mechanism for medical VQA is novel and timely. The paper applies spectral processing to both text and image features, and adapts fidelity-based similarity for knowledge retrieval—an interesting bridge between quantum-inspired IR and medical VQA. If the retrieval corpus and statistical testing were clarified, the contribution could be impactful. The reported cross-dataset gains (Table 2) suggest transferability of spectral features and retrieval benefits.

Strengths
- Clear motivation for frequency-domain processing in medical imaging (Introduction §1–§2.2) and credible FFT-based pipeline (Method §4.3.1).
- Dual contrastive objective that aligns modalities (Method §4.5.3–§4.5.4).
- Strong empirical results on VQA-RAD and zero-shot cross-dataset tests (Table 1–2).
- Ablations indicating component importance (Table 3), with frequency processing contributing the most.
- Thoughtful data splitting to avoid leakage at the image/patient level (§5.1).

Weaknesses
- Contradictions in feature integration and classification: whether k_agg is included (§4.5.1 vs. §4.5.2) and inconsistent retrieval inputs (§4.4.3 vs. §4.5.1).
- Insufficient detail on the external knowledge base (content, size, indexing, sources, medical curation) and its reproducibility (§4.4.3, §5.1).
- Ambiguous “convolution” in spectrum compression (§4.3.2) and missing shapes for gating (§4.3.3).
- Loss function inconsistency between §3 and §4.5.4; no rationale for weights or temperature choices beyond defaults.
- Statistical significance and AUC computation not fully described; unclear test methodology, confidence intervals, and multi-class AUC protocol (Table 1, §7.1).
- Baseline comparisons may be uneven (e.g., FSRU from social media rumor detection) without adaptation details; parameter counts for LLM-based methods are unclear.

Questions
1. Please reconcile the discrepancy between §4.5.1 (z_concat includes k_agg) and §4.5.2 (explicit exclusion of k_agg). Which is the final architecture used to produce Table 1 results?
2. What is the knowledge corpus (medical sources, size, indexing, license)? How are passages curated and updated? Is it radiology-specific or general biomedical?
3. What statistical test was used to compute p-values in Tables 1 and 3 (paired t-test over folds, Wilcoxon)? How was multi-class AUC computed (macro/micro, one-vs-rest)?
4. In §4.3.2, what are the exact filter shapes and strides if the operation is a convolution? If it is a linear projection, please rename and specify dimensions.
5. Can you show the equivalence of Uhlmann fidelity to squared cosine for pure states and explain why it outperforms cosine in practice (Table 3 “Cosine Similarity” row)?
6. What is the memory/compute footprint of fidelity-based retrieval vs. cosine, and how is the knowledge base stored (FAISS? custom)?
7. How were LLaVA-Med/STLLaVA-Med baselines handled given their 7B-scale models—full fine-tuning, LoRA, or inference-only? Please clarify training/inference settings and parameter counts.
8. Can you add error analysis stratified by question type (yes/no vs. categorical) and imaging modality (CT/MRI/X-ray), and a clinician review of outputs?

Rating

Summary
This paper introduces Q-FSRU, a medical VQA model that transforms both image and text features into the frequency domain with FFT, compresses spectral components via learnable filters, performs cross-modal gated enhancement, and augments reasoning with a quantum-inspired retrieval mechanism using Uhlmann fidelity. The approach is trained with combined cross-entropy and dual contrastive losses. Experiments on VQA-RAD (and zero-shot transfer to PathVQA) show gains over baselines; ablations attribute most improvement to the spectral processing.

Soundness
The frequency-domain approach is credible given known utility in medical imaging, and the dual contrastive losses are appropriate for multimodal alignment. However, several technical issues need resolution. The retrieval pipeline has inconsistent inputs (t_enhanced/v_enhanced in §4.4.3 vs. t_freq/v_freq in §4.5.1), and the classification head contradicts whether knowledge is included (compare §4.5.1 with §4.5.2). The spectrum compression is described as a “parameterized convolution,” but the equation in §4.3.2 is a linear projection; kernel sizes, strides, and padding are unspecified. The fidelity measure for pure states reduces to squared cosine similarity; the paper should analyze why fidelity helps over cosine in Table 3. Statistical reporting lacks details on tests and multi-class AUC computation.

Presentation
The manuscript is well structured and readable, with clear motivation and an informative schematic (Fig. 1). Nonetheless, readers will struggle with the noted contradictions and undefined implementation details (knowledge base curation, gating dimensions). Some axes/labels in the Appendix do not align with earlier definitions (e.g., sequence length up to 120 vs. L≤50 in §5.1). Baseline parameter counts are presented without explaining training regimen (full fine-tuning vs. adaptation).

Contribution
The proposed fusion of spectral features and quantum-inspired retrieval in Med-VQA is a novel combination that could influence future multimodal medical AI systems. Empirical improvements and cross-dataset generalization (Table 1–2) support practical value, pending clarification of methodology and reproducibility.

Strengths
- Strong and well-motivated use of frequency-domain processing for both modalities (§4.3.1).
- Integration of retrieval with a theoretically grounded similarity (Uhlmann fidelity) (§4.4.2–§4.4.3).
- Dual contrastive training to align modalities (§4.5.3–§4.5.4).
- Consistent improvements across metrics and datasets (Table 1–2).
- Careful data splitting to prevent leakage (§5.1).

Weaknesses
- Conflicting architectural descriptions for how knowledge is used in classification (§4.5.1 vs. §4.5.2).
- Incomplete description of the retrieval corpus and indexing strategy (§4.4.3, §5.1).
- Mislabeling of “convolution” with a linear operation (§4.3.2), missing tensor shapes for gates (§4.3.3).
- Loss formulations differ between §3 and §4.5.4 without justification for weight choices.
- Absence of statistical methods and AUC protocol details undermines claims of significance (Table 1, §7.1).

Questions
1. Is k_agg part of the classifier input or not? Please reconcile §4.5.1 with §4.5.2 and specify which variant produced Table 1.
2. What is the knowledge source (journals, textbooks, guidelines)? How large is it, how is it indexed, and how is medical quality ensured?
3. What statistical tests were used for p-values and how was multi-class AUC computed?
4. In §4.3.2, please provide exact filter dimensions and clarify whether the operation is convolution or a linear projection.
5. Why does fidelity outperform cosine in your setting despite pure-state equivalence? Any regularization or normalization differences?
6. How were LLaVA-Med and STLLaVA-Med baselines trained/evaluated given their scale (7B)? Were LoRA or adapters used?

Rating
- Overall (10): 6 — Interesting idea with promising results, but key methodological inconsistencies and incomplete retrieval details diminish trust (see §4.5, §4.4.3; Table 1).
- Novelty (10): 8 — Combining FFT-based fusion with quantum-inspired retrieval in Med-VQA is novel (see §4.3–§4.4; §2.3).
- Technical Quality (10): 5 — Sound core concepts but contradictions, unclear operations, and missing statistical protocol weaken rigor (see §4.3.2; §4.5.1–§4.5.2; §7.1).
- Clarity (10): 7 — Clear high-level narrative and helpful figures, hindered by internal inconsistencies and missing specifics (Fig. 1; §4.3.3; Appendix).
- Confidence (5): 4 — Familiarity with multimodal learning and IR; confidence moderated by unresolved contradictions and missing corpus details.

Summary
The authors present Q-FSRU for medical VQA, blending frequency-domain transformation (FFT on 256-d image/text vectors), unimodal spectrum compression with learnable filters, cross-modal gated co-selection, and a quantum-inspired retrieval mechanism that ranks external knowledge via fidelity. Training uses cross-entropy plus intra/cross-modal contrastive losses. Reported results on VQA-RAD and zero-shot PathVQA show improvements over several baselines, with ablations emphasizing the role of spectral processing.

Soundness
The medical imaging rationale for frequency-domain analysis is strong, and gating plus contrastive alignment are reasonable. Concerns remain: performing a 1D FFT on static 256-d embeddings may capture structure but the physical interpretability is limited; keeping only magnitudes discards phase, which can carry alignment information. The “convolution” in §4.3.2 is algebraic summation; kernel details are missing. The retrieval mechanism lacks corpus description and evaluation of retrieval quality or grounding (e.g., clinician verification). Architectural inconsistencies—whether k_agg is used for classification (§4.5.1 vs. §4.5.2) and which features feed retrieval (§4.4.3 vs. §4.5.1)—need resolution. Statistical methodology for p-values and AUC is unspecified.

Presentation
The paper is generally readable, with good motivation and figures. However, key implementation details are absent or inconsistent (knowledge base; filter and gate shapes; exact classification input). Appendix figures are helpful, but axes/labels sometimes conflict with earlier definitions (e.g., text sequence length). Baseline details (7B models) need clarification on training strategy, compute, and parameter counting.

Contribution
Applying spectral fusion to both modalities and introducing fidelity-based retrieval to Med-VQA is a meaningful contribution. If clarified and reproduced, the approach could inform future medical AI design, particularly the interplay between frequency representations and knowledge grounding.

Strengths
- Strong problem motivation for spectral features in medical imaging (§1, §2.2).
- Clear pipeline with frequency processing preceding retrieval (§4.2–§4.5.1; Fig. 1).
- Comprehensive ablation showing component contributions (Table 3).
- Cross-dataset generalization suggests transferable features (Table 2).
- Data handling avoids leakage by grouping questions per image (§5.1).

Weaknesses
- Unclear and contradictory integration of knowledge embeddings in classification (§4.5.1 vs. §4.5.2).
- Missing description of the external knowledge base (sources, size, indexing) and retrieval evaluation (§4.4.3).
- Mischaracterization of “convolution” and missing tensor dimensions for gates (§4.3.2–§4.3.3).
- Loss specification changes from §3 to §4.5.4 without rationale; temperature/weights appear ad hoc.
- Statistical testing and multi-class AUC computation not described (Table 1, §7.1).

Questions
1. Please specify the external medical knowledge corpus and its construction. How many documents, which sources, and how is veracity ensured?
2. Are knowledge embeddings excluded or included in the classifier input? The text is inconsistent; which variant produced the reported results?
3. What statistical test was used for p-values, and how was AUC defined for multi-class answers?
4. Can you justify discarding phase in FFT and show sensitivity analyses for keeping phase or complex spectra?
5. What are the exact filter shapes/operations in §4.3.2 and gate dimensions in §4.3.3?
6. How were large LLM baselines trained or adapted, and are parameter counts comparable?

Rating
- Overall (10): 8 — Strong empirical gains and a compelling fusion of spectral and quantum-inspired retrieval, tempered by methodological inconsistencies and missing retrieval corpus details (see Table 1–3; §4.4–§4.5).
- Novelty (10): 8 — Joint spectral fusion and fidelity-based retrieval in Med-VQA is a distinct and valuable idea (see §4.3–§4.4).
- Technical Quality (10): 7 — Solid core with gaps in consistency, retrieval corpus description, and statistical methods (see §4.5; §7.1).
- Clarity (10): 7 — Well written overall, but contradictions and missing details reduce clarity (see §4.3.2–§4.3.3; §4.5.1–§4.5.2).
- Confidence (5): 3 — Positive but cautious; claims plausible yet dependent on clarifications and reproducibility.

Summary
Q-FSRU proposes a frequency-domain multimodal fusion strategy combined with a quantum-inspired retrieval augmentation for medical VQA. Image and text features are transformed via FFT, compressed with learnable filter banks, enhanced through cross-modal gating, and then used to form a query for retrieving external knowledge with Uhlmann fidelity. The final classifier and training objective combine spectral features and contrastive losses; experiments report superior performance on VQA-RAD and improved zero-shot generalization to PathVQA.

Soundness
While the conceptual integration is appealing, reproducibility and rigor are limited by unresolved inconsistencies and missing retrieval details. The classification pipeline oscillates between including and excluding k_agg (§4.5.1 vs. §4.5.2), and retrieval inputs are inconsistent (§4.4.3 vs. §4.5.1). The FFT over a static 256-d feature vector is unconventional; rationale for discarding phase is not provided. Spectrum compression is not a convolution per the formula (§4.3.2). The knowledge corpus is unspecified, preventing verification of Quantum RAG’s contribution. Statistical significance is reported without methodology; multi-class AUC computation is not explained. Baseline comparisons with very large models lack training details, and fair comparisons may require standardized settings.

Presentation
The manuscript has a clear storyline and supportive visuals, but critical implementation specifics are absent (knowledge corpus details, filter/gate dimensions, baseline training). Appendix figures exhibit axis ranges that don’t match earlier definitions (e.g., sequence length 0–120 vs. L≤50 in §5.1), and several terms are misapplied (“convolution”). These issues impede independent reproduction.

Contribution
The combination of frequency-domain fusion and quantum-inspired fidelity retrieval for Med-VQA is novel and could be impactful if better substantiated. Reported cross-dataset gains indicate potential robustness.

Strengths
- Strong motivation and coherent high-level architecture (Introduction; Fig. 1).
- Frequency-domain emphasis is well aligned with medical imaging characteristics (§4.3.1).
- Ablation evidence for component contributions (Table 3).
- Thoughtful data splitting to avoid leakage (§5.1).
- Cross-dataset evaluation adds credibility (Table 2).

Weaknesses
- Architectural inconsistencies regarding k_agg in classification and retrieval inputs (§4.5.1–§4.5.2; §4.4.3).
- Missing knowledge base description and retrieval evaluation metrics (§4.4.3).
- Mischaracterized operations and missing dimensions in spectral compression and gating (§4.3.2–§4.3.3).
- Unspecified statistical testing and AUC methodology (Table 1).
- Baseline comparison setup unclear for large models.

Questions
1. Precisely define the knowledge base: sources, size, indexing, and medical validation. Provide a link for reproducibility.
2. Clarify whether k_agg is included in classification. If excluded, how does retrieval influence outputs beyond training?
3. Describe the statistical tests used for p-values and the protocol for multi-class AUC.
4. Provide exact tensor shapes and operations for §4.3.2–§4.3.3 (filters, gates).
5. Include sensitivity to phase information in FFT and explain the choice to discard phase.
6. Detail training/inference procedures for LLaVA-Med/STLLaVA-Med and parameter counts.

Rating

- Novelty (10): 8 — The fusion of spectral processing and quantum-inspired retrieval for Med-VQA is original (see §4.3–§4.4).
- Technical Quality (10): 4 — Multiple inconsistencies and incomplete methodological reporting reduce rigor (see §4.5.1–§4.5.2; §4.3.2; §7.1).
- Clarity (10): 6 — Clear narrative and figures, but key ambiguities and mislabeling persist (Fig. 1; Appendix; §4.3).
- Confidence (5): 4 — Careful analysis with moderate confidence; more details required for verification.
