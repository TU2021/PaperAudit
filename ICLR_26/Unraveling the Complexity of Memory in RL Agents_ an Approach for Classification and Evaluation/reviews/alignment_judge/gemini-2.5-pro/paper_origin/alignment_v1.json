        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions: providing conceptual clarity through a formal taxonomy and a unified evaluation framework for memory in RL, and demonstrating its importance experimentally. The alignment is very high, with Review B simply providing more technical detail (K, ξ, K̄, Algorithm 1) on the same points.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews agree that the experiments are limited, but Review B identifies several additional, major weaknesses absent from Review A, such as the lack of a positive control experiment and the failure to measure effective context length (K_eff). This results in only moderate alignment on weaknesses, as Review A's critique is much more generic.",
          "overall": "The reviews align strongly on the paper's strengths but diverge significantly on the specifics of its weaknesses, where the AI review is much more comprehensive and critical. While both see the paper as a valuable methodological contribution needing more empirical work, the substantive gaps in the critique lead to a moderate-to-high overall alignment."

        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews identify the paper's core strengths as the formalization of memory concepts, the proposal of a unified evaluation framework, and the experimental demonstration of evaluation pitfalls. Review B provides much greater detail and evidence for these same points but does not introduce different major strengths, leading to very high alignment.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews converge on the primary weakness being the limited empirical validation, with Review A calling it 'Limited Experiments' and Review B breaking it down into more specific issues like narrow environment scope and the lack of a positive LTM baseline. While the main theme aligns, Review A questions the novelty of the concepts while Review B critiques the specific mapping of declarative/procedural memory, showing some divergence in secondary points.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, concluding that the paper presents a valuable conceptual framework but is weakened by insufficient empirical support. While Review B is significantly more detailed, its core assessment of the paper's value and limitations is substantively the same as Review A's, resulting in a consistent focus and judgment."

Review B identifies several additional, significant weaknesses that Review A misses, including the lack of a positive LTM baseline, underspecified methodology, and major reporting gaps.",
          "overall": "The reviews align well on the paper's contributions but diverge significantly in their critique, with Review B being far more specific and comprehensive in identifying weaknesses. This results in only a moderate alignment, as Review A's high-level assessment misses multiple major issues raised by Review B."
