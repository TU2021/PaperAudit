  "baseline_review": "Summary\n- The paper studies transformers as unsupervised estimators for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). It proposes TGMM, a meta-trained framework that uses a shared transformer backbone with task-specific readouts to estimate mixture weights and means for multiple component counts K ∈ {2,3,4,5} (Section 2.2; Figure 1; Equation (2)). Empirically, TGMM is compared to EM and spectral methods across dimensions d ∈ {2,8,32,128}, tests distribution shifts in sample size and mean perturbations, and extends to anisotropic GMMs; ablations consider alternative backbones (Mamba2) and scaling (Section 3; Figures 2–6; Appendices E.1–E.4, Figures 10–17). Theoretically, the paper proves transformers can approximate EM iterations via softmax attention and MLPs (Theorem C.1; Figure 7/9) and can implement cubic tensor power iterations with ReLU attention (Theorem D.8; Figure 8), with uniform dimension/component adaptation under fixed parameters.Strengths\n- Bold, unified TGMM framework for multi-K GMM estimation\n  - Shared backbone with task-specific readouts supports s tasks simultaneously (Section 2.2; Figure 1), addressing practical multi-K scenarios with a single model—valuable for parameter efficiency and deployment.\n  - Explicit readout design (attentive pooling) decodes π̂ and μ̂ for each k (Section 2.2), improving clarity and enabling permutation-invariant extraction—important for technical soundness.\n  - Parameter efficiency discussion shows extra overhead O(s d D) vs backbone O(L D^2) (Appendix B), indicating architectural economy—impact for scaling and resource usage.- Comprehensive empirical study across dimensions, components, and robustness axes\n  - Main comparisons show TGMM competitive with spectral and often better than EM for K≥3 across d (Figure 2; Section 3.2), demonstrating effectiveness—experimental rigor.\n  - Robustness to sample size shift: trained with N∈[N0/2,N0], tested at N=128 (Figure 3; Section 3.2) shows graceful degradation—supports learning of an algorithm rather than memorization.\n  - Distribution shifts via mean perturbations σp show performance trends and relative behavior vs baselines (Figure 4; Section 3.2; Appendix Figures 12–14), establishing broader empirical picture—impactful evaluation diversity.\n  - Extensions to anisotropic GMMs with scale outputs and EM comparisons (Figure 6; Appendix E.1, Figure 14; Section 3.2) demonstrate flexibility—practical relevance.\n  - Alternative backbone (Mamba2) ablation (Figure 5; Appendix E.1; Figure 13) and backbone scaling (Figures 16–17; Appendix E.4) provide useful architectural insights—experimental rigor.- Clear, formal transformer definitions and theoretical constructions\n  - Precise definitions of attention, MLP, and transformer (Definitions 1–3;

Appendix C.2), methodologically insightful—novel mechanistic understanding.\n  - Theorem C.1 provides uniform approximation rates with parametric error Õ(√(d/N)) (Remark C.1), contributing to statistical guarantees—technical strength.\n  - Theorem D.8 (Appendix D.1–D.2) shows exact implementation of cubic tensor power iterations with ReLU attention and multi-head design (Figure 8), offering a novel transformer capability for high-order tensor operations—novelty and impact.- Careful evaluation metrics and permutation handling\n  - ℓ2-error defined with optimal permutation matching via Jonker-Volgenant (Section 3.1), plus clustering accuracy and log-likelihood reported in Appendix E.2 (Figures 10–11)—experimental rigor and clarity.- Implementation details and openness\n  - Training specifics (12-layer GPT-2 style, 4 heads, D=128, AdamW, 10^6 steps) and task sampling distributions (Section 3.1) promote reproducibility—clarity.\n  - Code repository link stated (Introduction, Block #4) and software stack disclosed (Appendix E.1)—impact on community use.Weaknesses\n- Theory–practice gap in spectral approximation and activation assumptions\n  - The tensor power iteration result omits normalization (Remark D.2) and uses ReLU attention rather than softmax (Definition 4; Remark D.3), limiting direct applicability to standard spectral algorithms—affects technical completeness and practical relevance.\n  - EM approximation relies on embedding and cleaning tricks (Appendix C.2; Figure 9) that assume access to initialized parameters and auxiliary fields (e.g., πlog, c, e_{i%K}), which may deviate from standard unsupervised pipelines—impacts realism.\n  - The construction requires N divisible by K and specific readout extraction (Appendix C.1 “N/K ∈ ℕ”; Remark C.3), which is a restrictive technical condition—limits generality.- Baseline configuration details and fairness are insufficiently specified\n  - EM initialization strategy, number of iterations, and convergence criteria are not detailed beyond Algorithm A.1 (Appendix A), yet EM performance is sensitive to initialization (Introduction; [34], [20])—affects fairness of comparisons.\n  - Spectral method behavior when K>d is stated as inapplicable (Introduction; Section 3.2), but plots include K=5 with d=2 (Figure 2), requiring clarification of how spectral was handled—clarity and fairness.\n  - Mamba2 setup “approximately matches” transformer parameters (Appendix E.1) without exact parameter counts or tuning parity; attentive pooling is used although RNNs could leverage last-state readout (Appendix E.1)—comparison rigor.- Robustness claims are mixed, especially under distribution shifts\n  - Under increasing σp, TGMM’s ℓ2-error grows rapidly and can be worse than spectral (Figure 4; Appendix Figure 12), contradicting “reasonable robustness” in Abstract—impact and consistency.\n  - Log-likelihood under high dimensions shows TGMM underperforming EM and spectral (Appendix E.2, Figure 10(c)/Figure 11(c)), indicating metric-dependent robustness—technical nuance.\n  - For K=2, TGMM’s error increases sharply with σp compared to EM and spectral (Appendix Figure 12(a); Figure 28), suggesting brittleness in easy regimes—experimental concern.- Clarity issues and heavy notation/encoding complexity\n  - The EM-approximation embedding introduces many auxiliary fields and multi-block structures (Appendix C.2, Equations (7), subsequent blocks), making the construction hard to parse—clarity.\n  - The readout mechanism requires specific attentive pooling and matched indexing (Appendix C.3; Remark C.3), but Section 2.2 uses softmax pooling; the differences between theoretical and practical readouts are relegated to remarks—clarity gap.\n  - Assumptions such as “drop samples to make N divisible by K” (Appendix C.1) and “choose D=O(d0+K0)” are not reconciled with empirical pipelines (Section 3.1)—expository coherence.- Limited evidence for generalization across unseen K and dimensions\n  - Training samples K uniformly from {2,3,4,5} (Section 3.1), and evaluation uses the same K set (Section 3.1; Figure 2), so generalization to unseen K is untested—impact claim of “varying component counts” is bounded by seen K.\n  - It is unclear whether a single trained TGMM backbone was evaluated across multiple d or separate models per d; Section 3.1 describes global configurations but does not state cross-d generalization within one backbone—clarity and generalization scope.\n  - Theorem C.1 allows d≤d0,K≤K0, but empirical validation for larger d or K0 beyond {2,…,5} is absent (Figure 2; Appendix E)—scope limitation.- Efficiency claims lack quantitative runtime/compute evidence\n  - Parameter efficiency discussion (Appendix B) is asymptotic; no wall-clock, training time, or memory benchmarks are reported, despite 10^6 training steps on 8×A100 GPUs (Section 3.1; Appendix E.1)—impact and practicality.\n  - No inference-time complexity measurements (e.g., scaling with N, K, d) are provided, though TGMM reads all tokens and performs pooling (Section 2.2)—technical completeness.\n  - No comparison of runtime vs EM/spectral (Section 3.2)—fairness and practical relevance.- Assumptions and scope of statistical regimes\n  - EM convergence analysis assumes well-separated means and good initialization (Appendix C.3, (8)–(10); Theorems C.2–C.4), but the empirical TaskSampler’s cosine similarity filtering (≤0.8) may not ensure separation (Section 3.1)—consistency.\n  - The theoretical analysis focuses on isotropic mixtures; anisotropic experiments (Figure 6; Appendix E.1) lack corresponding theoretical guarantees—scope mismatch.\n  - Theoretical ReLU-attention results (Appendix D) are not aligned with the softmax-attention backbone used in TGMM experiments (Section 3.1; Definition 1)—assumption misalignment.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Narrow the theory–practice gap for spectral approximation and activation assumptions\n  - Provide an analysis of normalized tensor power iterations or a bound for the normalization step (Appendix D.2; Remark D.2) to better approximate standard spectral algorithms.\n  - Discuss or extend the ReLU-attention result to softmax attention (Definition 1 vs. Definition 4; Remark D.3), quantifying approximation errors between activations to align with TGMM’s backbone.\n  - Relax restrictive conditions such as N/K ∈ ℕ and formalize readout equivalence between theoretical and practical pooling (Appendix C.1;

Section 3.2), demonstrating effectiveness—experimental rigor.\n  - Robustness to sample size shift: trained with N∈[N0/2,N0], tested at N=128 (Figure 3; Section 3.2) shows graceful degradation—supports learning of an algorithm rather than memorization.\n  - Distribution shifts via mean perturbations σp show performance trends and relative behavior vs baselines (Figure 4; Section 3.2; Appendix Figures 12–14), establishing broader empirical picture—impactful evaluation diversity.\n  - Extensions to anisotropic GMMs with scale outputs and EM comparisons (Figure 6; Appendix E.1, Figure 14; Section 3.2) demonstrate flexibility—practical relevance.\n  - Alternative backbone (Mamba2) ablation (Figure 5; Appendix E.1; Figure 13) and backbone scaling (Figures 16–17; Appendix E.4) provide useful architectural insights—experimental rigor.\n- Clear, formal transformer definitions and theoretical constructions\n  - Precise definitions of attention, MLP, and transformer (Definitions 1–3; Section 2.1) improve reproducibility and theoretical clarity—technical soundness.\n  - EM-approximation construction links softmax attention to weighted averaging in E/M steps (Section 4.2; Figure 7/9; Appendix C.2), methodologically insightful—novel mechanistic understanding.\n  - Theorem C.1 provides uniform approximation rates with parametric error Õ(√(d/N)) (Remark C.1), contributing to statistical guarantees—technical strength.\n  - Theorem D.8 (Appendix D.1–D.2) shows exact implementation of cubic tensor power iterations with ReLU attention and multi-head design (Figure 8), offering a novel transformer capability for high-order tensor operations—novelty and impact.\n- Careful evaluation metrics and permutation handling\n  - ℓ2-error defined with optimal permutation matching via Jonker-Volgenant (Section 3.1), plus clustering accuracy and log-likelihood reported in Appendix E.2 (Figures 10–11)—experimental rigor and clarity.\n- Implementation details and openness\n  - Training specifics (12-layer GPT-2 style, 4 heads, D=128, AdamW, 10^6 steps) and task sampling distributions (Section 3.1) promote reproducibility—clarity.\n  - Code repository link stated (Introduction) and software stack disclosed (Appendix E.1)—impact on community use.Weaknesses\n- Theory–practice gap in spectral approximation and activation assumptions\n  - The tensor power iteration result omits normalization (Remark D.2) and uses ReLU attention rather than softmax (Definition 4; Remark D.3), limiting direct applicability to standard spectral algorithms—affects technical completeness and practical relevance.\n  - EM approximation relies on embedding and cleaning tricks (Appendix C.2; Figure 9) that assume access to initialized parameters and auxiliary fields (e.g., πlog, c, e_{i%K}), which may deviate from standard unsupervised pipelines—impacts realism.\n  - The construction requires N divisible by K and specific readout extraction (Appendix C.1 “N/K ∈ ℕ”; Remark C.3), which is a restrictive technical condition—limits generality.\n- Baseline configuration details and fairness are insufficiently specified\n  - EM initialization strategy, number of iterations, and convergence criteria are not detailed beyond Algorithm A.1 (Appendix A), yet EM performance is sensitive to initialization (Introduction; [34], [20])—affects fairness of comparisons.\n  - Spectral method behavior when K>d is stated as inapplicable (Introduction; Section 3.2), but plots include K=5 with d=2 (Figure 2), requiring clarification of how spectral was handled—clarity and fairness.\n  - Mamba2 setup “approximately matches” transformer parameters (Appendix E.1) without exact parameter counts or tuning parity; attentive pooling is used although RNNs could leverage last-state readout (Appendix E.1)—comparison rigor; furthermore, Appendix E.2 reports cases where Mamba2 appears comparable or better than transformer in ℓ2-error (Appendix E.2, Table under Figure 13; e.g., K=4,d=2 and K=5,d=2), which needs reconciliation with the narrative and main plots (Figure 5)—reporting consistency.\n- Robustness claims are mixed, especially under distribution shifts\n  - Under increasing σp, TGMM’s ℓ2-error grows rapidly and can be worse than spectral (Figure 4; Appendix Figure 12), contradicting “reasonable robustness” in Abstract—impact and consistency.\n  - Log-likelihood under high dimensions shows TGMM underperforming EM and spectral (Appendix E.2, Figure 10(c)/Figure 11(c)), indicating metric-dependent robustness—technical nuance.\n  - For K=2, TGMM’s error increases sharply with σp compared to EM and spectral (Appendix Figure 12(a)), suggesting brittleness in easy regimes—experimental concern.\n- Clarity issues and heavy notation/encoding complexity\n  - The EM-approximation embedding introduces many auxiliary fields and multi-block structures (Appendix C.2, Equations (7), subsequent blocks), making the construction hard to parse—clarity.\n  - The readout mechanism requires specific attentive pooling and matched indexing (Appendix C.3; Remark C.3), but Section 2.2 uses softmax pooling; the differences between theoretical and practical readouts are relegated to remarks—clarity gap.\n  - Assumptions such as “drop samples to make N divisible by K” (Appendix C.1) and “choose D=O(d0+K0)” are not reconciled with empirical pipelines (Section 3.1)—expository coherence.\n- Limited evidence for generalization across unseen K and dimensions\n  - Training samples K uniformly from {2,3,4,5} (Section 3.1), and evaluation uses the same K set (Section 3.1; Figure 2), so generalization to unseen K is untested—impact claim of “varying component counts” is bounded by seen K.\n  - It is unclear whether a single trained TGMM backbone was evaluated across multiple d or separate models per d; Section 3.1 describes global configurations but does not state cross-d generalization within one backbone—clarity and generalization scope.\n  - Theorem C.1 allows d≤d0,K≤K0, but empirical validation for larger d or K0 beyond {2,…,5} is absent (Figure 2; Appendix E)—scope limitation.\n- Efficiency claims lack quantitative runtime/compute evidence\n  - Parameter efficiency discussion (Appendix B) is asymptotic; no wall-clock, training time, or memory benchmarks are reported, despite 10^6 training steps on 8×A100 GPUs (Section 3.1; Appendix E.1)—impact and practicality.\n  - No inference-time complexity measurements (e.g., scaling with N, K, d) are provided, though TGMM reads all tokens and performs pooling (Section 2.2)—technical completeness.\n  - No comparison of runtime vs EM/spectral (Section 3.2)—fairness and practical relevance.\n- Assumptions and scope of statistical regimes\n  - EM convergence analysis assumes well-separated means and good initialization (Appendix C.3, (8)–(10); Theorems C.2–C.4), but the empirical TaskSampler’s cosine similarity filtering (≤0.8) may not ensure separation (Section 3.1)—consistency.\n  - The theoretical analysis focuses on isotropic mixtures; anisotropic experiments (Figure 6; Appendix E.1) lack corresponding theoretical guarantees—scope mismatch.\n  - Theoretical ReLU-attention results (Appendix D) are not aligned with the softmax-attention backbone used in TGMM experiments (Section 3.1; Definition 1)—assumption misalignment.\n- Internal reporting inconsistencies and minor theoretical notation gaps\n  - Undefined constant “B” appears in the E-step derivation before being specified (Appendix C.2, attention update), though B is later implied by divisibility N/K—this affects correctness of the construction narrative—clarity.\n  - Layer-count mismatch between the informal and formal EM-approximation statements (Section 4.1: “2L-layer”; Appendix C.1, Theorem C.1: “2(L+1)-layer”)—consistency in theoretical statements matters for reproducibility.\n  - Anisotropic results show a discrepancy: main figure reports non-zero ℓ2-errors for K=2 across d (Figure 6; Section 3.2), while Appendix table reports 0.0 for EM and TGMM (Appendix E.2, Table under Figure 14)—internal consistency in reporting.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Narrow the theory–practice gap for spectral approximation and activation assumptions\n  - Provide an analysis of normalized tensor power iterations or a bound for the normalization step (Appendix D.2; Remark D.2) to better approximate standard spectral algorithms.\n  - Discuss or extend the ReLU-attention result to softmax attention (Definition 1 vs. Definition 4; Remark D.3), quantifying approximation errors between activations to align with TGMM’s backbone.\n  - Relax restrictive conditions such as N/K ∈ ℕ and formalize readout equivalence between theoretical and practical pooling (Appendix C.1; Remark C.3), with empirical checks demonstrating invariance to N mod K.\n- Improve baseline specification and fairness\n  - Detail EM initialization, iteration caps, and convergence criteria (Appendix A; Section 3.1), and include ablations with multiple inits (e.g., k-means, random) to quantify EM sensitivity.\n  - Clarify spectral handling when K>d (Section 3.2; Figure 2): if omitted, indicate so; if adapted, document the adaptation and its theoretical validity (Appendix A.2).\n  - Match parameter counts and training budgets precisely for Mamba2 vs transformer (Appendix E.1; Figure 5/13), and include last-state vs pooling readout comparisons with controlled hyperparameters.\n  - Ensure numerical consistency between main plots and appendix tables for Mamba2 comparisons, explicitly highlighting cases where Mamba2 performs similarly or better (Appendix E.2, Figure 13) to reconcile with the narrative (Figure 5).\n- Nuance robustness claims and strengthen OOD evaluations\n  - Temper the Abstract and RQ2 claims to acknowledge regimes where TGMM degrades (Figure 4; Appendix Figures 12–14), and add experiments with increased training diversity to mitigate σp sensitivity.\n  - Report robustness in log-likelihood alongside ℓ2 and accuracy (Appendix E.2, Figures 10–11), and investigate a likelihood-oriented auxiliary loss to improve performance in high-d regimes.\n  - For K=2, analyze why TGMM error spikes under perturbations (Appendix Figure 12(a)) and introduce regularization or readout modifications to stabilize estimation.\n- Enhance clarity and reduce encoding complexity\n  - Add a concise walkthrough of the EM-approximation construction (Appendix C.2; Figure 9) with a small worked example, mapping each attention/MLP block to the EM equations (Algorithm A.1).\n  - Unify the readout description between theory (linear attentive pooling, Appendix C.3) and practice (softmax pooling, Section 2.2) and justify the choice analytically or empirically.\n  - Reconcile theoretical preprocessing assumptions (N/K divisibility; D choices in Appendix C.1) with the empirical pipeline (Section 3.1), stating how violations are handled in practice.\n- Test generalization beyond seen K and across dimensions in a single backbone\n  - Train one TGMM backbone on K∈{2,3,4} and evaluate on unseen K=5 (Section 3.1; Figure 2), measuring generalization to component count outside training support.\n  - Explicitly evaluate a single trained backbone across multiple d in one run (Theorem C.1), or state that separate models are used per d; include results demonstrating cross-d generalization when applicable.\n  - Extend experiments to larger K0 and d0 (Appendix C.1) to empirically validate the uniformity claims in Theorem C.1 (Remark C.1).\n- Provide quantitative efficiency evidence\n  - Report training and inference times, memory footprints, and parameter counts for TGMM, EM, and spectral across d and K (Section 3.2; Appendix B), ideally with per-task latency and throughput.\n  - Include scaling plots of runtime vs N, K, d for TGMM’s attention and readout (Section 2.2), and discuss practical limits on N during inference.\n  - Present compute-normalized comparisons (e.g., FLOPs, GPU-hours) alongside accuracy to substantiate “parameter-efficient” claims (Appendix B).\n- Clarify statistical regimes and relate sampling to theoretical assumptions\n  - Quantify separation in TaskSampler (Section 3.1) beyond cosine similarity and relate it to Rmin bounds (Appendix C.3, (8)); add a well-separated regime to benchmark EM and spectral in their favorable conditions.\n  - Provide theoretical commentary on anisotropic GMMs, even partial (Appendix E.1), or delimit the scope explicitly as empirical for anisotropic extensions.\n  - Discuss activation misalignment between theory (ReLU attention, Appendix D) and practice (softmax, Section 3.1), and add an empirical comparison showing negligible differences or quantify gaps.\n- Address internal reporting inconsistencies and notation gaps\n  - Define the constant “B” at first use in the E-step derivation (Appendix C.2) and connect it explicitly to the N/K divisibility assumption (Appendix C.1) to ensure correctness of attention scalings.\n  - Harmonize the layer-count description across the paper (Section 4.1 “2L-layer” vs. Appendix C.1 Theorem C.1 “2(L+1)-layer”), and explain the extra layers’ role to avoid confusion.\n  - Reconcile anisotropic K=2 results between Figure 6 (Section 3.2) and Appendix E.2 (Figure 14 tables), correcting numerical inconsistencies or clarifying metric definitions to ensure reproducibility.Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Strong empirical breadth (Figures 2–6; Appendix Figures 10–17) and two meaningful theoretical insights (Theorem C.1; Theorem D.8), but notable theory–practice gaps (Remark D.2; Definition 4 vs Definition 1) and limited robustness in some regimes (Figure 4; Appendix Figure 12).\n- Novelty (10): 8 — New TGMM framework with shared backbone and first explicit construction for cubic tensor iteration via attention (Theorem D.8; Figure 8); EM approximation via attention weighting is thoughtfully executed (Figure 7/9; Appendix C.2).\n- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Formal statements and detailed constructions (Appendix C/D) are solid, but spectral approximation omits normalization (Remark D.2), relies on ReLU attention (Definition 4), and comparisons need stronger baseline specifications (Section 3.1; Appendix E.1).\n- Clarity (10): 6 — Core ideas are explained, but heavy notation and restrictive assumptions in Appendix C.2 (Equations (7), N/K divisibility) and readout differences (Remark C.3 vs Section 2.2) hinder readability; baseline details sparse.\n- Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence based on extensive anchors (Sections 2–4; Figures 1–6; Appendix C/D/E), though some experimental configuration details (EM init; spectral K>d) are unclear."
