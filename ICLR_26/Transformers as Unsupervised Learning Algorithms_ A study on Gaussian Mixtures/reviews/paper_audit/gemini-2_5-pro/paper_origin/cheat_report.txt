Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several significant internal inconsistencies and integrity risks have been identified. These issues materially affect the trustworthiness and scientific validity of the presented work.

### **1. Contradiction Between Plotted and Tabulated Experimental Results**

There are major, irreconcilable discrepancies between the data presented in the plots (Figures in Section 3 and Appendix E) and the corresponding summary tables (Figure 10 in Appendix E.2). These contradictions call into question the validity of the reported empirical results.

*   **Evidence (l2-error):**
    *   In the main text, the plot for K=5 (Block 25) shows an l2-error for the EM algorithm at d=2 of approximately **11.8**. However, the corresponding table in Appendix E.2 (Block 111, Figure 10a, K=5) reports this value as **7.0**. This is a substantial and unexplained difference.
    *   Similarly, for K=4 at d=2, the plot (Block 23) shows the l2-error for TGMM is visibly higher than for the Spectral method (approx. 4.2 vs. 3.0). The table (Block 111, Figure 10a, K=4) reports the TGMM error as **3.0**, identical to the Spectral method.

*   **Evidence (Clustering Accuracy):**
    *   The clustering accuracy plots in the appendix (e.g., Figure 10, Block 122) for K=4 at d=2 show TGMM performing comparably to the Spectral method and significantly better than EM (approx. 0.65 vs. 0.45). In stark contrast, the table in Appendix E.2 (Block 112, Figure 10b, K=4) reports TGMM's accuracy as **0.45**, identical to EM and worse than the Spectral method's 0.60.
    *   A similar contradiction exists for K=3 at d=2. The plot (Block 123) shows TGMM performing much better than EM (approx. 0.85 vs. 0.62), while the table (Block 112) reports their performance as identical (0.60).

These inconsistencies are not minor rounding errors; they represent different experimental outcomes and in some cases lead to opposite qualitative conclusions about the performance of the proposed TGMM model relative to baselines.

### **2. Inconsistency in Theoretical Assumptions vs. Empirical Setup**

The paper presents two main theoretical results, but the assumptions made for one of them directly contradict the architecture used in the empirical section. This is particularly concerning as the authors criticize prior work for a similar issue.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Theoretical Claim (Theorem 2):** The proof that transformers can approximate cubic tensor power iterations (a key part of spectral methods) explicitly assumes a **ReLU-activated attention** mechanism for technical tractability (Section 4.1, Block 37; Definition 4, Block 96).
    *   **Empirical Setup:** The experiments use a "GPT-2 type transformer encoder" (Section 3.1, Block 20), which uses the standard **Softmax** attention mechanism, as formally defined in the paper's own methodology (Definition 1, Block 11).
    *   **Self-Contradiction:** In the related work section (Block 8), the authors criticize a prior paper [21] for an "inconsistency in their assumptions" because it "assume[s] ReLU as the activation function" while its proofs rely on a lemma assuming softmax. The current manuscript commits a similar high-level inconsistency by developing a major theoretical result (Theorem 2) under assumptions (ReLU attention) that do not match its own empirical implementation (Softmax attention).

### **3. Contradiction Regarding the Applicability of the Spectral Method**

The manuscript makes a clear claim about a limitation of the spectral method which is then contradicted by the results presented in its own figures.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Claim:** In the introduction (Block 5), the paper states that the spectral method "requires the number of components to be smaller than the data’s dimensionality—an assumption that restricts its applicability to problems involving many components in low-dimensional GMMs".
    *   **Plotted Results:** Figure 2 (composed of plots in Blocks 22-25) presents results for the Spectral method in several cases where the number of components K is greater than the dimension d. For example, results are shown for (K=4, d=2) in Block 23 and (K=5, d=2) in Block 25.
    *   This is a direct contradiction. If the method is inapplicable under these conditions as claimed, no results should be presented. If a variant of the method was used that bypasses this limitation, it was not mentioned.

### **4. Inconsistent Figure Labeling in Appendix**

There is a notable error in the labeling of figures within the appendix, which creates confusion regarding the theoretical construction of the model.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   The label **Figure 9** is used for two entirely different diagrams. In Block 74, it refers to a `mermaid` flowchart. In Block 77, it refers to a much more detailed schematic of the transformer architecture for approximating the EM algorithm. The text in Block 71 refers to "Figure 9" as the formal version of the construction, making it unclear which diagram is the definitive one.

### **Conclusion**

The manuscript suffers from severe internal inconsistencies. The contradiction between plotted and tabulated data (Issue 1) is a critical flaw that undermines the credibility of the empirical evaluation. The mismatch between theoretical assumptions and the practical setup (Issue 2), the contradiction regarding the spectral method's limitations (Issue 3), and inconsistent figure labeling (Issue 4) further indicate a lack of rigor. These issues must be fully resolved before the manuscript can be considered for publication.
