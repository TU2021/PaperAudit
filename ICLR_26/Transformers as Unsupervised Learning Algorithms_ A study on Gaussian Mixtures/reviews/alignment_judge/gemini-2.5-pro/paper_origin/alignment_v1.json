          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the novel TGMM architecture that generalizes across tasks, the theoretical contributions linking transformers to EM and spectral methods, and the empirical validation showing competitiveness with classical algorithms. The alignment is very high, with Review B simply providing more granular detail on the same points.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify similar empirical weaknesses, such as the limitation to isotropic/synthetic data, overstated robustness claims, and issues with evaluation metrics like log-likelihood. However, Review B provides a much deeper critique of the theoretical contributions, pointing out strong assumptions and an incomplete implementation of spectral methods, which are major limitations that Review A misses.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's strengths and empirical weaknesses, but diverge significantly on the critique of its theoretical contributions. While both convey a similar message of a promising but limited paper, Review B's focus on the theoretical flaws represents a notable difference in judgment and substance compared to Review A."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the theoretical guarantees that transformers can approximate EM and spectral methods, and the strong empirical results showing the model is competitive and robust. Review B provides much greater detail and cites specific theorems, but the fundamental points are almost perfectly aligned with Review A.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on several weaknesses, including the limited GMM setup (isotropic covariance), issues with baseline comparisons, the need for more metrics like log-likelihood, and high computational costs. However, Review B introduces a major, distinct critique about the theory-practice gap (e.g., activation function mismatch) and is more critical of the generalization claims, points which are entirely absent from Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews show very high alignment on the paper's strengths but only moderate alignment on its weaknesses, as Review B identifies several fundamental issues missed by Review A. This leads to a divergence in critical depth and focus, with Review B questioning the paper's rigor more deeply due to the theory-practice gap. The overall judgment is thus only partially aligned."

          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's strengths but diverge significantly on its weaknesses, leading to a moderately aligned overall judgment. While both recognize the paper's contributions, Review B is far more critical, identifying fundamental flaws that Review A overlooks, resulting in a more skeptical assessment of the work."
