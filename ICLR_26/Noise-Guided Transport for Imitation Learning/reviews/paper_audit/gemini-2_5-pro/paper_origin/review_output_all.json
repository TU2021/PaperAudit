This complexity seems to contradict the claim that the method is \"easy to implement and tune\" (Abstract).\n    *   The paper notes that these hyperparameters must be adapted to the environment to achieve optimal results on non-Humanoid tasks (Appendix N, Figure 5), suggesting a non-trivial tuning effort may be required in practice.*   **Lack of Clarity on Experimental Protocol and Details**\n    *   The main text does not explicitly state which loss function (e.g., Huber or `ℓ_HLG`) was used for the non-Humanoid results presented in Figure 2, leaving the reader to infer this from the appendix (Appendix N, Section \"For the Humanoid...\").\n    *   The training duration for the Humanoid experiments (3x10^6 steps, per Figure 2) is inconsistent with the stated default and the duration for all other tasks (10^7 steps, per Appendix N, Table 1 and other plots in Figure 2), with no justification provided.\n    *   The \"20 transitions\" claim (Abstract, Figure 3) relies on subsampling rates (`subr`) that are not defined or explained in the main experimental setup (Section 5), hindering reproducibility.\n    *   The aggregated performance plot in the introduction (Figure 1) does not specify which tasks were included, making it difficult to assess whether it is a representative summary of performance.*   **Limited Exploration of the Prior Network Design**\n    *   The frozen prior network `f_ξ^†` is a cornerstone of the method, as it generates the target \"noise\" for the predictor (Section 4.1). However, the design space for this network is not explored in depth.\n    *   The paper justifies the use of Orthogonal Initialization (Section 4.3.1) and ablates against Kaiming initialization (Appendix N, Figure 6), but other architectural choices (e.g., network depth/width, activation functions, or alternative random initializations) are not discussed.\n    *   The quality and structure of the random mapping provided by the prior network seem fundamental to the learning signal, but the paper does not provide intuition or analysis on what constitutes a \"good\" prior.*   **Key Ablation Results are Relegated to the Appendix**\n    *   The ablation studies in Appendix N provide critical evidence supporting the method's design, but they are not mentioned or summarized in the main paper.\n    *   The finding that `ℓ_HLG` is essential for Humanoid (Appendix N, Figure 4) and that spectral normalization is critical for stability (Appendix N, Figure 7) are fundamental to understanding why NGT works.\n    *   Placing these crucial results entirely in the appendix weakens the self-containedness of the main paper and may cause readers to miss the full justification for the method's components.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Clarify and Reconcile the Theory-Practice Gap**\n    *   Explicitly acknowledge in the main text (e.g., Section 4.3 or 5) that the hyperparameters used for `ℓ_HLG` on the Humanoid task do not satisfy the 1-Lipschitz condition.\n    *   Discuss the implications of this violation. Does the method still approximate an OT distance, or does the objective function optimize something else in this regime? Provide intuition for why the method works well despite the violation.\n    *   To fully resolve the issue, it would be ideal to show that strong performance can be achieved on Humanoid with hyperparameters that *do* satisfy the 1-Lipschitz constraint, or with a different 1-Lipschitz loss.*   **Acknowledge and Discuss the Role of the Distributional Loss**\n    *   In the main text (e.g., Section 5), explicitly state that the `ℓ_HLG` loss was essential for the Humanoid results and discuss the trade-off between its performance benefits and the introduction of new hyperparameters.\n    *   Briefly discuss the role of the `ℓ_HLG` hyperparameters (`N`, `σ`, etc.) and provide intuition for their tuning, perhaps linking them to task complexity as suggested in Appendix N.\n    *   To strengthen the \"easy to tune\" claim, it would be beneficial to show that a reasonable default setting for `ℓ_HLG` works well across a range of tasks, or provide a simple heuristic for setting its parameters.*   **Improve Transparency and Consistency of the Experimental Protocol**\n    *   In the main experimental section (Section 5), clarify which loss was used for each family of environments (e.g., \"We used the Huber loss for all tasks except Humanoid-v4...\").\n    *   Justify the shorter training duration for the Humanoid experiments in the main text or align it with the protocol for other experiments.\n    *   Clearly define the subsampling rates (`subr10`, `subr20`, `subr50`) in Section 5 to properly contextualize the results in Figure 3 and the \"20 transitions\" claim.\n    *   Specify in the caption of Figure 1 which tasks were included in the aggregation to ensure the plot is representative and verifiable from Figure 2.*   **Expand on the Prior Network's Role**\n    *   Add a short discussion in Section 4.1 or 4.3 about the design of the prior network `f_ξ^†`.\n    *   Acknowledge that the architecture and initialization of the prior are important design choices and briefly motivate the current approach beyond the ablation results.\n    *   Suggesting that the exploration of more structured or learned priors could be an avenue for future work would add valuable context.*   **Integrate Key Ablation Findings into the Main Paper**\n    *   Incorporate a concise summary of the most critical ablation results into the main experimental section (Section 5).\n    *   For example, a brief paragraph discussing the findings from Appendix N, Figures 4 and 7 would significantly strengthen the paper's narrative by immediately justifying the use of `ℓ_HLG` and spectral normalization.\n    *   Alternatively, a small, well-chosen figure in the main text could summarize 2-3 key ablations (e.g., `ℓ_HLG` vs. MSE on Humanoid, with vs. without SN) to make the paper more self-contained.5) Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — The paper presents a novel and empirically powerful method, but its technical claims are weakened by a theory-practice gap and several clarity issues in the experimental reporting.\n- Novelty (10): 9 — The formulation of adversarial reward learning as predicting random priors within an optimal transport framework is highly novel and insightful (Section 4.1, 4.2).\n- Technical Quality (10): 7 — The theoretical analysis is undermined by a violation of its core 1-Lipschitz assumption in the implementation for the paper's best result (Theorem 4.2, Appendix N Table 1).\n- Clarity (10): 6 — The paper is generally well-written, but is hampered by inconsistent experimental details and the relegation of critical results and justifications to the appendix (Figure 2, Appendix N).\n- Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, as the paper provides detailed methodology, theory, and extensive empirical evidence that I have carefully checked."
