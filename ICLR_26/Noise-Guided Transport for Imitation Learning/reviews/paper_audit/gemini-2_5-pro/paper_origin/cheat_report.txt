Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several clear internal inconsistencies and methodological discrepancies have been identified that affect the paper's scientific validity and trustworthiness.

### Integrity and Consistency Risk Report

**1. Contradiction Between Theoretical Grounding and Practical Implementation**

The manuscript's central theoretical claim is that the proposed method, NGT, optimizes the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) between the agent and expert distributions. This claim is explicitly predicated on the potential function `h_ξ` being 1-Lipschitz.

-   **Evidence (Theory):** Section 4.2, Equation 3 establishes the equivalence between the NGT objective and the EMD by optimizing over the space of 1-Lipschitz potentials: `inf_{h_ξ ∈ H_ξ^1} [...] = - EMD(...)`. Section 4.3 further states the practical goal is to ensure the Lipschitz constant `Λ(h_ξ) ≤ 1`.
-   **Evidence (Implementation):** For the key results on the high-dimensional Humanoid task, the paper states that the histogram loss `ℓ_HLG` was required for successful training (Section 4.3.2, Appendix N Figure 4).
-   **Inconsistency:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of this loss in Theorem 4.2, deriving an upper bound on its Lipschitz constant: `Λ ≤ √(1 + (C/σ)^2)`. Using the hyperparameters provided in Appendix N, Table 1 (`N=21`, support `[-1, 1]`, `σ=0.05` for the agent-side loss), the calculated Lipschitz constant for `ℓ_HLG` is significantly greater than 1 (approximately 3.7). This directly contradicts the necessary condition for the claimed EMD equivalence. The paper's practical implementation for its strongest result is therefore inconsistent with its core theoretical foundation. The authors note that `Λ` can grow unbounded for small `σ` but do not acknowledge that their own chosen hyperparameters violate the 1-Lipschitz condition.

**2. Inconsistent Experimental Protocol for Key Result**

There is an unexplained discrepancy in the training duration between the main showcased task (Humanoid) and all other tasks.

-   **Evidence (Protocol):** Appendix N, Table 1 ("Default Hyper-parameters") states the "Number of environment steps" is 10^7.
-   **Evidence (Results):** The performance plots in Figure 2 show that experiments for Ant, HalfCheetah, Pusher, and Walker2d are run for 10^7 timesteps. However, the plots for the Humanoid-v4 task, which is highlighted as a key contribution, are shown for only 3x10^6 timesteps.
-   **Inconsistency:** The manuscript provides no justification for why the training protocol for the Humanoid experiments deviates from the stated default and from the protocol used for all other environments.

**3. Potentially Misleading Aggregated Performance Figure**

The primary summary figure in the introduction may present an overly optimistic view of the method's performance due to undisclosed data exclusion.

-   **Evidence (Figure 1):** The caption for Figure 1 states, "Performance of a subset of methods, aggregated over tasks and number of demonstrations. Humanoids not included." The figure shows a very smooth and high-performing curve for NGT.
-   **Evidence (Figure 2):** The detailed per-task results in Figure 2 show that while NGT performs well on Ant, HalfCheetah, and Walker2d, its performance on Pusher-v4 is substantially lower and more variable, especially in the low-data settings.
-   **Inconsistency:** The caption for Figure 1 does not specify which tasks *are* included in the aggregation. The stark difference in performance on the Pusher-v4 task suggests it may have also been excluded from the aggregate plot. Without this clarification, Figure 1 may not be a representative summary of the method's performance across all non-Humanoid tasks presented in the paper.

**4. Incomplete Description of Experimental Variables**

The main text's description of the experimental setup is incomplete, omitting details that are critical to supporting a central claim made in the abstract.

-   **Evidence (Abstract):** The abstract claims NGT achieves strong performance "with as few as 20 transitions" (Block 2).
-   **Evidence (Methods):** Section 5 ("Experiments") describes the data setup as using "1, 4, and 11 expert demonstrations, subsampled at a rate of 20," which yields 50 transitions for 1 demonstration (Block 18). This setup does not produce a 20-transition case.
-   **Inconsistency:** The "20 transitions" claim is only substantiated by results presented in Figure 3, which introduces a new experimental variable, "subsampling rates" (`subr10`, `subr20`, `subr50`). These rates and their meaning are not defined or mentioned in the main experimental setup description in Section 5. This makes the setup for a key claim difficult to understand and reproduce from the main text alone.

**Conclusion**

The manuscript contains several high-impact internal inconsistencies. The most significant is the contradiction between the theoretical requirement of a 1-Lipschitz potential function for the EMD connection and the practical use of a loss function that violates this condition in the key Humanoid experiments. Combined with unexplained deviations in experimental protocol and incomplete descriptions of the experimental setup, these issues materially affect the trustworthiness and scientific validity of the presented work.
