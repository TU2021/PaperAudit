          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the novel, lightweight optimal transport-based approach for low-data imitation learning, its strong empirical performance (especially on Humanoid), and its efficiency from avoiding gradient penalties. The alignment is very high, with both emphasizing the same key contributions.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews criticize the insufficient number of random seeds and raise concerns about the Lipschitz constant claims. However, Review B identifies several major technical flaws missed by Review A, including a fundamental conceptual error in the OT interpretation, unfair baseline modifications, and a contradiction in hyperparameter tuning claims.",
          "overall": "The reviews align strongly on the paper's strengths and its overall positive contribution, but they diverge significantly in their critical assessment. While Review A focuses on presentation and clarity, Review B provides a much deeper technical critique, identifying a core conceptual error, which represents a substantial difference in focus and judgment."

          "weakness": "Both reviews criticize the heuristic enforcement of the Lipschitz condition and issues with experimental rigor (e.g., few seeds, unfair tuning). However, Review B identifies a major theoretical gap in the policy-reward linkage that Review A misses, while Review A focuses more on presentation and comparison to prior work.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned on the paper's strengths, leading to a similar positive overall assessment, but they diverge on several weaknesses, with Review B offering a deeper theoretical critique. This results in a high-moderate substantive alignment, as the core judgment is consistent despite different critical perspectives."

Despite the divergence on the most critical weakness, the high-level assessment of the paper's profile (promising but flawed) is largely consistent."
