Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several major internal inconsistencies and integrity risks have been identified. These issues are substantive and call into question the validity and trustworthiness of the reported research.

### **1. Use of Non-Existent Models and Future-Dated Citations**

A significant portion of the paper's analysis relies on models and sources that do not appear to exist at the time of this review, with citations dated in the future (2025). This fundamentally undermines the credibility of the reported results.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Models:** The manuscript reports results for "GPT-5" (Blocks #6, #17, #98), "GPT-4.1" (Blocks #5, #17, #98), "Claude Opus 4.1" (Blocks #5, #17, #99), and "Qwen 2.5" (Blocks #5, #17, #127). These models are not known to be publicly released or documented at this time.
    *   **Citations:** The reference list and in-text citations contain numerous entries for the year 2025. Examples include:
        *   `OpenAI. Introducing GPT-5, 2025b.` (cited in Block #6)
        *   `OpenAI. Introducing GPT-4.1 in the API, 2025a.` (cited in Block #17)
        *   `Anthropic. Claude Opus 4.1, 2025.` (cited in Block #17)
        *   `Bai et al. Qwen2.5-VL Technical Report. ... 2025.` (cited in Block #17)
        *   `Yang et al. Qwen3 technical report. ... 2025.` (cited in Block #5)
        *   `Zhou et al. The geometry of reasoning... 2025.` (cited in Block #33)
        *   Multiple conference papers from EMNLP 2025 and ACL 2025 (Blocks #40, #41).

*   **Impact:** The results associated with these non-existent models are unverifiable and cannot be considered scientifically valid. The use of future-dated citations for both model announcements and academic papers is a serious breach of academic practice and suggests that the evidence base for this work may be fabricated.

### **2. Severe Numerical Inconsistencies in Reported Results**

There are numerous, irreconcilable contradictions between data presented in tables, corresponding figures, and descriptive text. These inconsistencies are not minor rounding errors but represent fundamentally different data, suggesting a profound lack of care in data handling or potential misrepresentation of results.

*   **Evidence (Figure 3): Class Distribution**
    *   The data presented in the text table "Figure 3" (Block #21) is wildly inconsistent with the data shown in the corresponding bar charts (Blocks #23-26).
    *   **Example 1 (Finetuned NL, Qwen-3 1.7B):**
        *   The text table (Block #21, top-right) contains a garbled entry: `0: 44.0%, 1: 63.2%, 70.5%, 46.4%`.
        *   The plot (Block #24, grey bar) shows: `-1: 8.4%, 0: 45.2%, 1: 46.4%`. These numbers do not match the text and are inconsistent with other values in the text table.
    *   **Example 2 (Non-Finetuned NNL, Qwen-3 1.7B):**
        *   The text table (Block #21, bottom-left) claims the model predicted label `1` for 100.0% of cases (`-1: 0.0%, 0: 0.0%, 1: 100.0%`).
        *   The plot (Block #25, grey bar) shows the model had 82.3% parsing errors (`-1`), 6.6% label `0`, and 11.1% label `1`. These two reports are diametrically opposed.
    *   **Mathematical Error:** The text entry for non-finetuned NL Qwen-3 1.7B (`-1: 0.0%, 0: 4.1%, 1: 100.0%`) sums to 104.1% (Block #21).

*   **Evidence (Figure 6): Fine-tuning Loss Curves**
    *   The data in the text table "Figure 6" (Block #55) does not match the plotted curves (Block #57).
    *   **Example (Qwen3-1.7B):**
        *   The table (Block #55) shows the loss converging to `0.15`.
        *   The plot (Block #57, red line) shows the loss converging to approximately `0.55`. The text in Appendix B.6 also states the loss converges to `≈ 0.5`, contradicting the table it accompanies.
    *   **Example (BART-Base):**
        *   The table (Block #55) shows a starting loss of `0.45`.
        *   The plot (Block #57, green line) shows a starting loss of `0.75`.

*   **Impact:** These pervasive numerical contradictions make it impossible to trust any of the quantitative results presented in the paper. Such errors are far beyond typical manuscript preparation mistakes and indicate fundamental problems with the data analysis and reporting.

### **3. Contradictory Experimental Setup and Claims**

The description of the experimental methodology contains internal contradictions, making the comparisons between models misleading.

*   **Evidence (Table 1): Inference Time Comparison**
    *   The caption for Table 1 (Block #32) states it shows the "Average inference time in hours for **zero-shot**".
    *   However, a footnote to the table clarifies: "For BART-Base, Flan-T5-Base and Qwen3-1.7B, we consider the **finetuned version** of these models."
    *   This is a direct contradiction. The table compares the inference time of finetuned models against zero-shot API calls, which is an invalid, apples-to-oranges comparison. The "efficiency" metric derived from this is therefore meaningless.

### **Conclusion**

The manuscript is affected by critical flaws that compromise its scientific integrity. The reliance on apparently fictitious models and future-dated citations makes a significant part of the work unverifiable. Furthermore, the pervasive and severe numerical inconsistencies between tables, figures, and text suggest that the reported data is unreliable. Due to these fundamental issues, the manuscript does not meet the standards for scientific publication.
