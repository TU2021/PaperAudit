          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the method is training-free and widely applicable, it introduces a novel spectral perspective using eRank, and it empirically improves exploration (Pass@k). The alignment is very high, with minor differences only in granularity and phrasing.",
          "weakness": "There is partial overlap on concerns about computational cost and theoretical gaps. However, Review A uniquely highlights practical issues like moderate gains and dependency on a base model, while Review B finds critical technical errors (implausible figure values, ambiguous method description) that Review A misses.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's strengths but diverge significantly in their critiques, with Review A focusing on practical limitations and Review B on technical errors. This difference in focus leads to a moderate overall alignment, as they prioritize different aspects of the work's flaws."

However, each review also raises unique major concerns: Review A highlights the dependency on a paired base model, while Review B points to specific figure errors, narrow baseline comparisons, and the absence of a safety evaluation.",

While their overall judgment is similar (a good idea with notable flaws), their focus differs, with Review A emphasizing practical applicability and Review B focusing on technical and experimental rigor."
