          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on two major weaknesses: the limitation to feature attribution methods and the questionable reliability of simulated human judgments. However, each review also raises several unique points, with the human focusing on scalability and baselines, and the AI focusing on augmentation theory and the modest results of the human study.",
          "overall": "The reviews show strong alignment on the paper's contributions and a similar positive-but-critical judgment, but only moderately align on the specific weaknesses. While they agree on two key limitations, they diverge on other important critiques, with the AI being more technically focused and the human more practically focused."

The alignment is very high, with differences mainly in the level of detail rather than substance.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on several key weaknesses, such as the method's limited scope to feature attribution, the unvalidated simulation of human judgments, and scalability concerns. However, Review B introduces multiple major critiques absent from Review A, including the lack of theoretical grounding, the evaluation's focus on proxy metrics over user outcomes, and the limited analysis of prediction correctness.",
          "overall": "The reviews align well on the paper's strengths but only moderately on its weaknesses, where Review B is more comprehensive and critical. While both reviews reach a similar conclusion of a promising but flawed paper, their focus differs, as Review B identifies several fundamental conceptual and methodological gaps that Review A overlooks."
