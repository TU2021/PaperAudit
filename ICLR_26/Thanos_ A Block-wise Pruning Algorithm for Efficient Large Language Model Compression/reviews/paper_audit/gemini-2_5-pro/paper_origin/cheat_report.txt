Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several significant internal inconsistencies and methodological issues have been identified that affect the scientific validity and trustworthiness of the presented work.

### Integrity Risk / Inconsistency Report

**1. Contradictory Claims Regarding Performance in Unstructured Pruning**

The manuscript presents conflicting statements about the performance of the proposed Thanos algorithm in unstructured pruning scenarios.

*   **Overstated Claim:** The Abstract (Block #2) claims that Thanos "outperforms existing methods in unstructured pruning." A similar strong claim is made in the zero-shot evaluation section (Block #38): "Thanos remains competitive and outperforms other methods in unstructured sparsity."
*   **Contradictory Evidence (Tables):** The results presented in Table 2 (Perplexity) and Table 3 (Zero-shot Average) do not consistently support this claim. For unstructured 50% sparsity, Thanos is outperformed by Wanda or SparseGPT in several cases (e.g., LLaMA-2 7B/13B/70B PPL, LLaMA-2 1.1B/7B/13B zero-shot, LLaMA-3 8B/70B zero-shot). The performance is best described as "competitive" or mixed, not superior.
*   **Contradictory Admission:** The Limitations section (Block #49) directly contradicts the claims in the main text, stating: "SparseGPT often surpasses it in zero-shot evaluation tasks in unstructured sparsity."

This inconsistency between the claims in the abstract/main text, the presented data, and the limitations section constitutes a significant overstatement of the method's contribution in the unstructured pruning setting.

**2. Numerical Mismatch Between Figure and Table**

There is a clear and substantial numerical discrepancy between the results presented in Figure 1(b) and Table 2 for the structured pruning experiment on the LLaMA-3 8B model.

*   **Source 1 (Table 2, Block #37):** For LLaMA-3 8B with 30% structured sparsity, the reported perplexity (PPL) values are:
    *   SparseGPT: 82.19
    *   Thanos (α = 0): 64.43
    *   Thanos (α = 0.1): 36.61
*   **Source 2 (Figure 1(b), Block #11):** The plot, which the caption (Block #6) identifies as the same experiment, shows markedly different values at a sparsity ratio of `p = 0.30`:
    *   SparseGPT (blue line): PPL ≈ 52
    *   Thanos (α = 0, green line): PPL ≈ 45
    *   Thanos (α = 0.1, purple line): PPL ≈ 32

The values for SparseGPT (82.19 vs. ~52) and Thanos (α=0) (64.43 vs. ~45) are substantially different. Such a significant mismatch between a table and a figure supposedly reporting the same result raises serious concerns about the reliability and correctness of the experimental data.

**3. Inconsistent Mathematical Formulation of the Core Method**

The manuscript provides three different and conflicting mathematical expressions for the weight update rule in structured pruning, which is presented as a key contribution.

*   **Version 1 (Algorithm 2, Line 10, Block #30 & Eq. 13, Block #30):** The update is given as `W_{:,1:s} - W_{:,1:s} (H_{1:s,1:s}^{-1})^{-1} H_{1:s,:}^{-1}`. The presence of `(H^{-1})^{-1}` and a second inverse `H^{-1}` appears mathematically incorrect for a least-squares update.
*   **Version 2 (Algorithm 7, Line 10, Block #111):** The update is given as `W_{:,1:s} - W_{:,1:s} (H_{1:s,1:s}^{-1}) H_{1:s,:}`. This version is different from the first and also appears mathematically questionable.
*   **Version 3 (Eq. 72, Appendix G.4.2, Block #106):** The update is given as `− W_{:,1:s} (H_{1:s,1:s})^{-1} H_{1:s,:}`. This form is mathematically plausible for a constrained least-squares problem but is inconsistent with the formulas presented in both Algorithm 2 (main text) and Algorithm 7 (appendix).

This lack of a single, correct, and consistently used formula for a central part of the proposed algorithm undermines the paper's technical soundness and reproducibility.

**4. Unfair Comparison in Semi-Structured Pruning Experiments**

The experimental setup for semi-structured pruning with outlier handling (`α > 0`) is methodologically flawed, leading to an unfair comparison that favors the proposed method.

*   **Method Description (Block #35):** The authors state that for semi-structured sparsity (e.g., 4:8 or 2:4, both 50% sparsity), using `α = 0.1` (10% outlier rows) reduces the effective sparsity. For an initial sparsity `p = 0.5`, the final sparsity becomes `p_effective = 0.5 * (1 - 0.1) = 0.45`.
*   **Unfair Evaluation (Table 2 & 3):** In the 4:8 and 2:4 sparsity sections of Tables 2 and 3, `Thanos (α = 0.1)` is directly compared against baseline methods (SparseGPT, Wanda) that are evaluated at the full 50% sparsity. The proposed method is pruning 10% fewer weights than the baselines it is being compared against.
*   **Invalidated Conclusion:** This setup invalidates the claims of superior performance for `Thanos (α = 0.1)` in semi-structured settings, as its improved results are likely attributable, at least in part, to the lower effective sparsity level. A fair comparison would require evaluating the baselines at 45% sparsity or adjusting the Thanos method to achieve a final sparsity of 50%.

### Conclusion

The manuscript contains multiple high-impact inconsistencies, including contradictory performance claims, a significant numerical mismatch between reported results, a confused and inconsistent definition of the core algorithm, and a methodologically unfair experimental comparison. These issues materially affect the paper's scientific validity and require substantial revision and clarification before the work can be considered reliable.
