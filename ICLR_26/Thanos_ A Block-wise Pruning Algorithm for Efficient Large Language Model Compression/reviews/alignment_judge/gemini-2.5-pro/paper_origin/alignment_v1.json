          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the block-wise pruning method, flexibility for different sparsity patterns, hardware-aware design, and strong empirical results. Review B provides more technical depth on these points, but the substance is highly aligned with Review A.",
          "weakness": "There is strong overlap on the lack of inference speed/memory metrics and the need for more ablations. However, they diverge significantly elsewhere, with Review A noting limited model generalization while Review B introduces distinct critiques about unfair baseline comparisons and overstated claims.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned on the paper's strengths and core contribution, but only moderately aligned on its weaknesses, where each identifies unique major issues. This results in a similar overall judgment—a solid paper with evaluation gaps—but from partially different critical perspectives."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core strengths as the novel block-wise pruning approach, support for multiple sparsity patterns (structured, n:m), and strong empirical results on LLaMA/OPT models. Review B provides more technical granularity on the method's derivation and adaptive masking, but the main highlighted contributions are the same.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews strongly agree on the primary weaknesses: unsubstantiated efficiency claims (lack of runtime/memory analysis) and a need for more ablation studies. While Review A notes general clarity issues, Review B identifies a major specific weakness missed by the human reviewer: notational errors and likely incorrect mathematical formulas.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in substance and judgment, agreeing that the paper presents a promising method with strong empirical results but significant gaps in its practical efficiency analysis and experimental rigor. Review B's deeper technical dive uncovers specific formulaic errors, making its critique more pointed, but the overall assessment of the paper's pros and cons is largely consistent with Review A."
