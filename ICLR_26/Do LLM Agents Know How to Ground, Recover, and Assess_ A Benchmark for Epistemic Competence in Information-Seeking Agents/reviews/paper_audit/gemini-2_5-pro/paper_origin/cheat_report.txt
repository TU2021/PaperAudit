Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several significant internal inconsistencies and integrity risks have been identified. These issues pertain to the framing of the core contribution, the consistency of the methodology, the interpretation of results, and numerical accuracy.

### 1. Inconsistency in the Core Contribution and Evaluation Data

The paper's central contribution is presented as "SeekBench," a benchmark of 190 expert-annotated traces. This is emphasized in the Abstract, Introduction, and Methodology.

-   **Evidence:**
    -   **Abstract (Block #2):** "SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps..."
    -   **Introduction (Block #8):** "SeekBench includes 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 steps..."
    -   **Methodology (Block #16):** "Three expert annotators independently coded 190 agent traces..."

However, all the main experimental results, analyses, and conclusions presented in Section 4 are based on a different, much larger dataset annotated by an LLM, not human experts.

-   **Evidence:**
    -   **Experiments (Block #26):** "Our evaluation comprises 28,493 traces and 283,950 steps across all models and datasets. For this large-scale annotation, we employ GPT-4.1-mini..."

**Problem:** There is a fundamental mismatch between the advertised contribution (an expert-annotated benchmark) and the actual source of the paper's primary findings (a large-scale, LLM-annotated dataset). The 190-trace expert dataset was used only to validate the annotation schema, not to generate the results shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, and Tables 2-5. This framing is misleading, as it suggests the paper's findings are derived directly from expert annotations when they are not.

### 2. Contradictory Naming and Methodological Definitions

There are clear inconsistencies in terminology and definitions between the main body and the appendix, suggesting a lack of careful preparation.

-   **Contradictory Benchmark Name:** The appendix introduces a different name for the benchmark without explanation.
    -   **Evidence (Appendix 8, Block #62):** "This section presents the comprehensive LLM-as-judge used in **CompetenceBench** to evaluate agent reasoning..." The rest of the paper refers exclusively to "SeekBench." This appears to be a significant copy-paste error.

-   **Inconsistent Reasoning Schema:** The number and types of reasoning categories differ between the methodology and the appendix.
    -   **Evidence (Methodology, Block #16):** The schema is described with **three** reasoning types: "InformationSynthesis," "PlanFormation," and "StateAssessment."
    -   **Evidence (Appendix 8.1, Block #63):** The LLM-as-judge prompt defines **four** reasoning types, adding "**CritiqueAndCorrection**." This fourth category is never mentioned or analyzed in the results sections, creating a direct contradiction between the described method and its claimed implementation.

### 3. Contradictory Interpretation of Quantitative Results

The manuscript contains textual interpretations that directly contradict the data presented in its own figures.

-   **Misinterpretation of Base Model's Capabilities:** The conclusion claims the Base model has strong reasoning, which is not supported by the paper's own reasoning metrics (RQI).
    -   **Evidence (Conclusion, Block #39):** "...Base models demonstrate stronger reasoning capabilities than accuracy metrics suggest."
    -   **Contradictory Evidence (Figure 2, Blocks #30, #31):** The Base model's overall RQI (0.23) is lower than the Few-shot model's (0.27). Its type-level RQI scores for Information Synthesis (0.46) and State Assessment (0.12) are among the lowest of all tested models.
    -   **Contradictory Evidence (Appendix 12, Block #86):** The paper's own analysis of the agent synthesis experiment concludes that the Base model is strong at "collecting high-quality evidence but struggling with synthesis," not reasoning. The conclusion's claim is a significant overstatement that misrepresents the paper's own findings.

-   **Misinterpretation of Search-R1's Groundedness:** The appendix text describes Search-R1's performance in a way that is inconsistent with the corresponding figure.
    -   **Evidence (Appendix 10.1, Block #75):** The text states, "SEARCH-R1 exhibits significant epistemic misalignment, with **elevated groundedness** even under insufficient evidence (≈ 0.10 at E = 1 and 0.14 at E = 2), suggesting grounded reasoning."
    -   **Contradictory Evidence (Figure 6/73, Blocks #69, #73):** The chart shows that Search-R1's groundedness scores of 0.10 and 0.14 are extremely low and, in fact, the worst among nearly all models in those conditions (e.g., Base model scores are 0.49 and 0.64). Describing these near-zero values as "elevated" is a direct contradiction of the visual data.

### 4. Numerical Inconsistencies and Errors

Multiple numerical mismatches were found between claims in the text, tables, and figures.

-   **LLM-Judge Agreement Score:** A claim in the introduction is directly contradicted by a value reported in the methodology.
    -   **Evidence (Introduction, Block #9):** The paper claims "...LLM judges with strong alignment to expert annotations (κ > 0.7)."
    -   **Contradictory Evidence (Methodology, Block #16):** The reported score for one of the judges is explicitly stated as "GPT-4.1 (κ = 0.693)," which is not greater than 0.7.

-   **Agent Synthesis Results:** The caption for Table 5 reports a different value than the one present in and calculated from the table itself.
    -   **Evidence (Table 5, Block #82):** The table shows an "Overall Avg. ΔF1" of **+1.27** for Search-R1 as a synthesizer.
    -   **Contradictory Evidence (Table 5 Caption, Block #82):** The caption states, "Search-R1 demonstrates the highest overall improvement (**+1.06 F1**) across all evidence sources..."

### Conclusion

The manuscript suffers from multiple high-impact inconsistencies that undermine its credibility. The misleading framing of the core contribution, contradictions between the methodology and appendix, misinterpretations of key results, and clear numerical errors collectively represent a significant integrity risk. These issues must be addressed before the work can be considered for publication.
