The introduction claims LLM judge alignment of κ > 0.7 (Section 1), but the methodology reports κ = 0.693 for GPT-4.1 (Section 3.1). The caption for Table 5 reports an F1 improvement of +1.06 for Search-R1, while the table itself reports +1.27 (Appendix 12).4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Acknowledge and Characterize Limitations of LLM-as-Judge**\n    *   To address the reliance on a small human-annotated set, the authors should explicitly discuss the potential limitations of this scale in the main paper.\n    *   To strengthen the large-scale results, the authors should add a discussion on the potential for systematic bias from the LLM judge. It would be beneficial to include a brief qualitative or quantitative error analysis on a small, random sample of the LLM-judged data, highlighting specific cases where the LLM judge agrees or disagrees with human annotators.\n    *   This analysis could be added to Appendix 7 to provide readers with a clearer understanding of the LLM judge's failure modes and build more confidence in the main experimental findings.*   **Refine or Justify the \"Evidence State\" Definition**\n    *   The authors should consider refining the evidence state to a two-dimensional vector `(C_i,t, Q_i,t)` instead of a scalar sum. This would allow for a more fine-grained analysis that distinguishes between the different types of partial evidence.\n    *   Alternatively, if the authors maintain the current definition, they should provide a justification for why summing clarity and sufficiency is appropriate and perhaps show empirically that the \"unclear but sufficient\" state is rare or can be reasonably grouped with the \"clear but insufficient\" state.\n    *   This would strengthen the analyses in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 by removing the ambiguity and allowing for a more precise interpretation of how agents behave in different partial-information scenarios.*   **Discuss the Scope and Generalizability of the Findings**\n    *   The authors should add a paragraph in the discussion or conclusion (e.g., Section 5 or a new discussion section) explicitly acknowledging that the findings are based on a single model family (Qwen). This would appropriately scope the claims.\n    *   In the same discussion, the authors should clarify that their conclusions about \"RL training\" apply to the specific set of methods evaluated and may not generalize to all forms of RL-based agent tuning.\n    *   The authors could briefly suggest that future work should validate these findings across a wider range of model architectures (e.g., Llama, Mistral) and agent training paradigms to establish the generality of the observed trade-offs.*   **Resolve Methodological and Numerical Inconsistencies**\n    *   The authors should unify the benchmark's name throughout the manuscript.\n    *   The reasoning schema should be made consistent between the methodology section and the appendix, and all defined categories should be accounted for in the analysis.\n    *   All interpretive claims in the text should be carefully re-checked against the data presented in figures and tables to ensure they are fully supported by the evidence.\n    *   The manuscript should be thoroughly proofread to correct numerical values and ensure consistency between the introduction, methodology, results, and appendix.5) Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — The paper introduces a valuable benchmark and novel metrics, but several inconsistencies between the text, data, and methodology weaken confidence in the reported findings (Figure 2, Section 5, Appendix 8).\n- Novelty (10): 9 — The conceptual framework of epistemic competence and its operationalization into concrete metrics (RQI, ERF, CE) is highly novel for this domain (Section 3.3).\n- Technical Quality (10): 7 — The core methodology is rigorous, but it is undermined by inconsistencies in the defined schema, contradictory interpretations of results, and numerical errors (Section 3.1, Appendix 8.1, Figure 6).\n- Clarity (10): 8 — The paper is generally well-written and structured, but contradictions between the text and figures, along with inconsistent terminology, detract from its overall clarity (Section 5, Appendix 8).\n- Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment as the topic is directly within my area of expertise."
