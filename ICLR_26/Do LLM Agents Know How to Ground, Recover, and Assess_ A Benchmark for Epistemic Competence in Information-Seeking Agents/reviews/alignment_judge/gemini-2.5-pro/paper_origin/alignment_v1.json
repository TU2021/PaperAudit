          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the timely focus on process-level evaluation, the clear conceptualization of epistemic competencies, and the key empirical insight that RL training can degrade grounded reasoning while improving other metrics. The alignment is very high, with Review B simply offering more granular evidence (e.g., specific kappa scores) for the same high-level points made in Review A.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the same three primary weaknesses: flawed metric design, the small human-annotated dataset, and over-reliance on an LLM-as-judge. However, Review B provides much more specific and technical critiques of the metrics (e.g., penalizing plan-only steps, ignoring cumulative evidence), while Review A raises unique broader concerns like the lack of a feedback loop into agent training, resulting in a high but not perfect match.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, portraying the paper as a valuable contribution with important findings but significant methodological weaknesses in its metrics and evaluation setup. The near-perfect alignment on strengths and strong thematic overlap on weaknesses result in a consistent take-home message, with differences primarily in the level of technical detail and a few unique secondary critiques."

Review B provides more granular points, but these are elaborations of the same fundamental strengths highlighted in Review A.",
          "weakness": "There is strong alignment on the two most critical weaknesses: the small human-annotated dataset combined with a heavy reliance on LLM-as-judge, and the under-motivated or potentially biased metric designs (RQI, CE). However, they diverge on secondary points, with Review A focusing on the narrow scope of tools/models, while Review B identifies specific numerical inconsistencies and reproducibility issues.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high overall alignment, as they strongly agree on the paper's main strengths and its most significant weaknesses, leading to a consistent judgment of the work's value and limitations. The primary divergence is in the nature of their secondary critiques, with Review A being more conceptual and Review B more focused on specific empirical and reproducibility details."

However, their critiques, while overlapping on some key issues, also introduce distinct and major concerns from different perspectives (scope vs. internal correctness), resulting in a moderate overall alignment in substance."
