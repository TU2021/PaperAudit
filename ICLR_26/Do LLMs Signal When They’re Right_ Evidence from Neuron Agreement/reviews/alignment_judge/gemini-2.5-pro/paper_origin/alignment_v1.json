The alignment is very high, with nearly identical emphasis on the key contributions.",
          "weakness": "There is strong overlap on major weaknesses, including the lack of rigorous baselines, insufficient statistical validation, and unproven claims of superiority over simpler metrics like entropy. Review B adds more specific technical critiques (FFN-only modeling, coarse Jaccard similarity) not present in Review A, which prevents a perfect match.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, viewing the paper as a novel, promising idea with strong efficiency gains that is held back by a need for more rigorous validation and broader comparisons. While there are minor differences in the specific weaknesses raised, their substantive focus and final assessment are very consistent."
