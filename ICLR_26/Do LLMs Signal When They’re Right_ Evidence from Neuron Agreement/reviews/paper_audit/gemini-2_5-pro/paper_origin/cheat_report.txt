Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several significant internal inconsistencies and logical contradictions have been identified that affect the paper's scientific validity and reproducibility.

### Integrity and Consistency Risk Report

**1. Contradictory and Ambiguous Figure Numbering and Referencing**

The manuscript contains numerous errors in figure numbering, captioning, and referencing, which severely hinders the reader's ability to connect textual claims to their corresponding visual evidence.

*   **Duplicate Figure Numbers:** There appear to be two different figures labeled as "Figure 5". One is a mermaid diagram in the text (Block 19), and the other is a more detailed schematic (Block 21).
*   **Mislabeled and Reused Figure Components:** There is a critical conflict regarding the image in Block 34.
    *   The caption for Figure 4 (Block 14) describes a "Figure 4(b)" showing that correct answers activate fewer neurons. The histogram in Block 34, which shows exactly this, is a candidate for this figure part, but it is explicitly labeled "(a)".
    *   The same histogram from Block 34 is later referenced as part of Figure 7 in Section 5.3 (Block 26), where it is meant to represent the "top-k = 2K" setting.
    *   This dual use of a single, mislabeled image for two different figures (Figure 4b and Figure 7a) creates a direct contradiction.
*   **Mismatched Captions and Figures:** The caption for Figure 3 is located in Block 14, while the corresponding image is in Block 16. Similarly, the caption for Figure 4 is in Block 14, while its constituent parts are scattered across Blocks 17 and 18.

**2. Inconsistent Baseline Performance Reported Across Tables**

The baseline performance metric, Avg@64 (mean accuracy over all 64 samples), should be constant for a given model and dataset. However, it is reported with different values across the paper's main results table and the appendix table, indicating data reporting errors.

*   **Evidence:** Comparison of Avg@64 for the `Qwen3-4B-Think` model between Table 1 (Block 23) and Appendix Table 3 (Block 42):
    *   **HumanEval:** Reported as **96.0** in Table 1, but **97.0** in Table 3.
    *   **LCBv5:** Reported as **61.9** in Table 1, but **58.7** in Table 3.
    *   **MBPP:** Reported as **84.6** in Table 1, but **85.6** in Table 3.
*   **Impact:** These discrepancies in the baseline values undermine the credibility of the reported performance gains for the proposed NAD methods, as the reference point for comparison is inconsistent.

**3. Contradictory Definition of the Core Method for Neuron Activation**

The manuscript provides two conflicting descriptions of the fundamental method used to identify "activated neurons," which is central to the entire paper.

*   **Description 1 (Main Text):** Section 3.1 (Block 9) states that the activated neuron set is computed by taking the union of activated neurons over chunks of the output sequence, based on a threshold $\eta$ (Eq. 3). This is presented as the primary method.
*   **Description 2 (Appendix):** Appendix B (Block 41) details a different, more complex procedure. It states, "In this paper, we adopt a top-k threshold function," involving a token-level, layer-wise top-k selection followed by a cross-layer top-k to define the threshold. It explicitly claims, "This token-level thresholding is always applied in our main method."
*   **Impact:** These two descriptions are not equivalent and represent different methodologies. This contradiction makes the work non-reproducible and leaves it unclear which method actually produced the reported results.

**4. Implausible Results in Early Stopping Experiments**

A comparison between the full-sequence results (Table 1) and the early-stopping results (Table 2) reveals a highly improbable outcome that suggests a data error.

*   **Evidence:** For the `Qwen3-4B-Think` model on the AIME24+25 dataset:
    *   The `NAD-Medoid` method is reported to achieve an accuracy of **81.7%** with full sequences (Table 1, Block 23).
    *   The same `NAD-Medoid` method is reported to achieve the exact same accuracy of **81.7%** with early stopping after only 32 tokens (Table 2, Block 25).
*   **Impact:** It is extremely unlikely that a selection method based on only the first 32 tokens would perform identically to one using the entire generated sequence, especially when other similar methods (`NAD-kNN`, `NAD-DBSCAN`) show a performance drop in the same experiment. This suggests a copy-paste error or a flaw in the experimental reporting.

**5. Contradiction Between High-Level Claims and Detailed Results**

The paper's abstract and introduction make strong, general claims that are not fully supported by, or are contradicted by, the detailed results presented in tables and figures.

*   **Claim vs. Data (Coding Performance):** The abstract (Block 2) claims that on open-ended coding benchmarks, "NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64." However, the results for the `NAD-MinAct` variant in Table 1 (Block 23) contradict this. For `Qwen3-4B-Think`, `NAD-MinAct` (58.1 on LCBv5, 92.7 on HumanEval) underperforms `Avg@64` (61.9 on LCBv5, 96.0 on HumanEval). This shows the claim of consistent outperformance is not true for all proposed variants of NAD.
*   **Claim vs. Data (Early Stopping Efficacy):** The abstract (Block 2) emphasizes the effectiveness of early stopping at 32 tokens with "minimal loss in generation quality." However, the paper's own analysis in Figure 8 (Block 33) shows that for `NAD-kNN`, performance at 32 tokens (80.0% accuracy) is substantially lower than the peak performance achieved when stopping much later at 4096 tokens (86.7% accuracy). The 5-point accuracy drop for `NAD-kNN` between the full sequence (85.0% in Table 1) and 32-token stopping (80.0% in Table 2) is significant and challenges the characterization of the quality loss as "minimal."

**Conclusion:**

The manuscript suffers from multiple, clear internal inconsistencies, including contradictory methodological descriptions, inconsistent reporting of baseline data, mislabeled and duplicated figures, and claims that are not fully substantiated by the detailed results. These issues materially affect the paper's trustworthiness and reproducibility and must be addressed before the work can be considered scientifically valid.
