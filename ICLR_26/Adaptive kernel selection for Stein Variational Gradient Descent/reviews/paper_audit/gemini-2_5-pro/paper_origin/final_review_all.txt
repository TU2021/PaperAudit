1) Summary
This paper proposes Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a method to improve Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) by dynamically tuning kernel parameters. The core problem addressed is SVGD's high sensitivity to the choice of kernel, particularly the bandwidth, which often leads to poor performance and variance collapse in high dimensions when using standard heuristics. The proposed method alternates between standard SVGD particle updates and updating the kernel parameters via gradient ascent on the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD). The authors provide a theoretical analysis in the mean-field setting, extending existing convergence results to show that the maximal KSD over the kernel class converges to zero. Empirically, Ad-SVGD is shown to outperform the standard median heuristic on several tasks, including an ODE-based inverse problem and Bayesian logistic regression, by better capturing posterior uncertainty and improving approximation quality.2) Strengths
*   **Principled and Well-Motivated Method**
    *   The core idea of maximizing the KSD to select the kernel at each step is theoretically well-grounded. It directly connects to maximizing the instantaneous rate of KL divergence decrease, as shown in Equation (2), providing a clear and principled objective for kernel adaptation.
    *   The method is flexible and general. It can be applied to any parameterized family of kernels, as stated in Section 3, and is demonstrated with product kernels allowing for dimension-specific bandwidths (Section 5.1), which is a significant improvement over a single scalar bandwidth.
    *   The implementation is practical and leverages existing computations. The paper notes that the gradient ascent step for kernel parameters reuses the score function gradients `∇ log π(X_n^i)` from the SVGD update, avoiding additional expensive evaluations (Section 3).*   **Thorough and Convincing Empirical Validation**
    *   The experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of Ad-SVGD over the standard median heuristic (Med-SVGD), especially in mitigating the known issue of variance underestimation. This is clearly shown in the ODE inverse problem (Figure 3b, Figure 2) and supported by metrics in the Bayesian logistic regression (BLR) experiment (Figure 5).
    *   The paper evaluates the method on a diverse set of problems, including a 1D toy example (Section 5.2), a higher-dimensional linear inverse problem (Section 5.3, d=16), and a standard BLR benchmark (Section 5.4, d=55). Additional experiments in the appendix further explore scaling with dimension (Appendix A.2) and another GP inference task (Appendix A.3).
    *   The evaluation metrics are comprehensive and well-chosen. The authors use Wasserstein distance (Figure 1, Figure 3a), MMD (Figure 5), prediction accuracy (Figure 5), and direct comparison of moments like marginal variances (Figure 3b, Tables 1 & 2) and covariance matrices (Figure 7), providing a multi-faceted view of performance.
    *   The visualizations are effective at highlighting the method's benefits. For instance, the evolution of the component-wise bandwidths (Figure 4a, Figure 6) provides insight into the adaptive mechanism, and the Q-Q plots (Figures 13 & 14) offer a clear qualitative assessment of the marginal posterior approximations.*   **Rigorous Theoretical Analysis**
    *   The paper provides a formal convergence analysis in the mean-field limit (Section 4), which lends theoretical credibility to the proposed approach.
    *   The analysis successfully extends existing convergence results for SVGD with fixed kernels [32] to the proposed adaptive setting. Lemma 1 and Corollary 2 establish that the supremum of the KSD over the kernel class converges to zero.
    *   The theory is carefully developed to handle both an idealized setting where the KSD is perfectly maximized (Equation 9) and a more practical setting where maximization is approximate (Equation 10), leading to the main result in Theorem 3.
    *   The refined analysis in Appendix B, which assumes a Stein log-Sobolev inequality, provides stronger results on KL divergence convergence and derives iteration complexity bounds (Theorem 4), further deepening the theoretical understanding.3) Weaknesses
*   **Significant Gap Between Theory and Practice**
    *   The main theoretical result (Theorem 3) relies on Assumption 4, which states that the error in maximizing the KSD, `ε_n`, must vanish as `n → ∞`. The practical algorithm (Algorithm 1) uses a fixed number of gradient ascent steps, for which there is no guarantee that this assumption holds. The authors acknowledge this as a limitation in Section 6.
    *   The theoretical analysis is conducted in the mean-field (infinite particle) limit (Section 4). While standard for SVGD theory, this does not directly address the finite-particle dynamics used in practice, where the empirical KSD is a noisy estimate of the true KSD.
    *   The step-size condition for the particle updates (e.g., in Lemma 1) depends on properties of the true posterior `π` and the initial distribution `μ_0`, which are generally unknown, making the theoretical conditions difficult to verify or enforce in practice.*   **Limited Comparison to State-of-the-Art Baselines**
    *   The experiments exclusively compare Ad-SVGD to vanilla SVGD with the median heuristic. While this is a crucial baseline, the paper does not compare against other advanced SVGD variants designed to tackle high-dimensional problems or variance collapse, such as those using matrix-valued kernels [37], sliced discrepancies [10], or geometric modifications like Grassmann SVGD [21], all of which are cited in the related work (Section 1.1).
    *   The paper's stated goal is to isolate the effect of kernel selection (Section 1.2), but this choice makes it difficult to assess whether Ad-SVGD offers a competitive advantage over other modern approaches in the broader literature. Without these comparisons, the practical impact of the method relative to the current state-of-the-art is unclear.*   **Potential Scalability and Computational Cost Concerns**
    *   The KSD calculation and its gradient with respect to kernel parameters are computationally intensive. The U-statistic formulation for KSD² (Equation 4) has a computational complexity of O(M²d), where M is the number of particles. The gradient ascent step adds further overhead.
    *   The paper suggests subsampling particles to reduce cost when M is large (Section 3) but does not provide any empirical results to validate this strategy or analyze the trade-off between computational cost and approximation quality.
    *   The experiments are conducted on problems with relatively low to moderate dimensionality (d ≤ 55). The performance and computational feasibility of optimizing d separate bandwidths in truly high-dimensional settings (e.g., d > 1000, as in Bayesian neural networks) are not explored.*   **Experimental Inconsistencies and Missing Evidence**
    *   A key claim in the Bayesian logistic regression experiment is not visually supported by the provided figure. The text in Section 5.4 claims that "Med-SVGD severely underestimates the posterior uncertainty" and points to Figure 7 for visual confirmation, but Figure 7 only contains covariance plots for "MCMC" and "Ad-SVGD", omitting the necessary plot for Med-SVGD.
    *   There is a direct contradiction in the setup of the multivariate normal experiment. The text in Appendix A.2 states the target covariance is `Σ_d = diag(1, 1/2, ..., 1/d)`, but the "Target" marginal variances reported in Tables 1 and 2 correspond to a covariance of `Σ_d = diag(1, 1/4, ..., 1/d^2)`. This discrepancy affects the clarity and reproducibility of the results.4) Suggestions for Improvement
*   **Bridge the Theory-Practice Gap**
    *   To strengthen the link between theory and practice, provide an empirical analysis of Assumption 4. This could involve plotting the KSD maximization error `ε_n` (i.e., `max_θ KSD² - KSD²_θn`) over iterations in the experiments to see if it does, in fact, decrease. Alternatively, discuss theoretical conditions on the KSD landscape or the gradient ascent procedure that might lead to `ε_n → 0`.
    *   Include a discussion on the implications of the mean-field analysis for the finite-particle regime. For example, briefly discuss how sampling error in the empirical KSD might affect the optimization of `θ` and the overall convergence.
    *   Acknowledge the practical difficulty of verifying the step-size conditions and clarify that the step sizes in the experiments were chosen empirically, which is standard practice.*   **Broaden Experimental Comparisons**
    *   To better position the work, include at least one stronger baseline from the recent SVGD literature in a key experiment (e.g., the BLR experiment in Section 5.4). A comparison against a method like Grassmann SVGD [21] or a matrix-valued kernel approach [37] would provide a much clearer picture of Ad-SVGD's practical utility.
    *   If adding new experiments is not feasible, expand the discussion in the conclusion or related work to hypothesize how Ad-SVGD might compare to these other methods. For example, discuss the potential for combining adaptive kernel selection with other SVGD improvements, as briefly mentioned in Section 6.*   **Address Scalability and Computational Cost**
    *   Provide a more explicit analysis of the computational complexity of an Ad-SVGD iteration compared to a standard SVGD iteration, clarifying the dependence on M, d, and the number of kernel parameters.
    *   Conduct a small-scale experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed subsampling strategy. This could involve showing the performance of Ad-SVGD on one of the existing tasks while using only a subset of particles to compute the KSD gradient, and reporting both the final approximation quality and the runtime.
    *   Discuss the potential challenges and strategies for scaling the method to higher dimensions. For instance, mention that the product kernel with d parameters might be too expensive and that other, more structured kernel parameterizations (as alluded to in Section 5.1) would be necessary.*   **Clarify Experimental Results and Correct Discrepancies**
    *   To substantiate the claim in Section 5.4, either add the missing covariance matrix plot for Med-SVGD to Figure 7 or revise the text to remove the reference to this figure as visual evidence for Med-SVGD's performance.
    *   Resolve the contradiction in Appendix A.2 by ensuring the text description of the target covariance matrix matches the numerical "Target" values used in Tables 1 and 2.5) Score
*   Overall (10): 6 — The paper presents a well-motivated method with promising results, but its impact is significantly weakened by a gap between theory and practice, limited baselines, and notable inconsistencies in the experimental reporting (Figure 7, Appendix A.2).
*   Novelty (10): 7 — The specific mechanism of using gradient ascent on the KSD to continuously optimize kernel parameters is novel, though the general idea of adapting kernels for SVGD has been previously explored (e.g., Ai et al. [1]).
*   Technical Quality (10): 7 — The theoretical derivations are sound under their stated assumptions (Section 4), but the experiments contain inconsistencies (Appendix A.2) and unsupported claims (Section 5.4, Figure 7), which detract from the overall rigor.
*   Clarity (10): 7 — The paper is generally well-written, but significant discrepancies between the text, figures, and tables (e.g., Figure 7, Appendix A.2) create confusion and hinder reproducibility.
*   Confidence (5): 5 — I am very confident in my assessment, as I am familiar with the literature on Stein variational methods and have carefully checked the manuscript's claims against its own evidence.
