Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several internal inconsistencies and discrepancies have been identified that affect the paper's scientific validity and reproducibility. These issues require clarification and correction.

### Integrity and Consistency Report

**1. Missing Evidence for a Key Claim in the Bayesian Logistic Regression Experiment**

A central claim regarding the performance of the median heuristic (Med-SVGD) is not supported by the evidence presented in the corresponding figure.

*   **Claim:** In Section 5.4, the authors state: "We observe that Med-SVGD severely underestimates the posterior uncertainty, while Ad-SVGD gives a better approximation. Additionally, Figure 7, which shows the covariance matrices of the final particles compared to the MCMC reference... We observe that Med-SVGD severely underestimates the posterior uncertainty..." (Block #33).
*   **Evidence:** Figure 7, as captioned in Block #38 ("Covariance matrices of final SVGD particle sets compared to MCMC samples"), is intended to support this claim. However, the figure panels provided only show the covariance matrices for "MCMC" (Block #40) and "Ad-SVGD" (Block #41).
*   **Inconsistency:** The covariance matrix for "Med-SVGD" is not included in Figure 7. Therefore, the figure does not provide the visual evidence needed to substantiate the critical claim that Med-SVGD underestimates posterior uncertainty in this experiment. The reader cannot verify this comparison from the provided materials.

**2. Contradiction in the Experimental Setup for the Multivariate Normal Distribution**

There is a direct contradiction between the description of an experiment in the appendix and the numerical values presented in the corresponding tables.

*   **Method Description:** In Appendix A.2, the experiment is described as using "Gaussian target distributions π_d = N(0, Σ_d) with Σ_d = diag(1, 1/2, …, 1/d)" (Block #48). This implies the marginal variance for the k-th component is `1/k`.
*   **Results:** Tables 1 and 2 (Blocks #56, #57) present the results for this experiment. The "Target" row in both tables lists the theoretical marginal variances of the target distribution. These are:
    *   Component 1: 1.0000
    *   Component 2: 0.2500 (= 1/4)
    *   Component 3: 0.1111 (≈ 1/9)
    *   Component 4: 0.0625 (= 1/16)
    *   ...and so on, up to Component 8 with variance 0.0156 (≈ 1/64).
*   **Inconsistency:** The target variances reported in Tables 1 and 2 correspond to a covariance matrix of `Σ_d = diag(1, 1/4, 1/9, ..., 1/d^2)`, not `diag(1, 1/2, ..., 1/d)` as stated in the text (Block #48). This factual mismatch between the described methodology and the presented results undermines the clarity and reproducibility of the experiment.

**Summary**

The manuscript contains clear internal inconsistencies that represent a high risk to its scientific integrity. The failure to provide visual evidence for a key comparative claim and the direct contradiction in the setup of a core numerical experiment are significant issues that must be addressed.
