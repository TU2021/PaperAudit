Academic integrity and internal consistency risk report

Summary
The manuscript presents Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD) with theory in the mean-field limit under Talagrand’s inequality and an extended result under a generalized Stein log-Sobolev inequality. The empirical section compares Ad-SVGD to the median heuristic across several tasks. While the paper is generally well-structured, there are several substantive, evidence-backed inconsistencies and missing details that materially affect theoretical correctness and algorithmic definability.

High-impact issues

1) Regularity mismatch between theory/derivations and the kernels used in experiments
- Evidence:
  - Algorithmic and theoretical derivations explicitly rely on kernel derivatives up to second order: Equation (5) defines uπ^k(x,y) using ∇x k, ∇y k and trace(∇x∇y k(x,y)); Equation (3) uses ∇_{X_n^j} k(X_n^i, X_n^j); Section 4.1 invokes Proposition 3.1 in [32], which depends on smoothness and boundedness conditions (Assumptions 1–3).
  - Section 5.1 specifies the experimental kernel family with p = 1: k_h(x,y) = ∏_{i=1}^d exp(−|x_i − y_i|^p / h_i) with p = 1. This kernel is not twice differentiable at x_i = y_i because of the absolute value.
- Problem:
  - For p = 1, the needed second derivatives ∇x∇y k(x,y) in Equation (5) do not exist at coincident points (x = y), and the first derivatives are non-differentiable at zero. This directly conflicts with the use of Equation (5) to compute KSD^2 and its gradient w.r.t. θ (Section: Method, Algorithm 1). Moreover, in the SVGD particle update (Equation (3)), the sum includes j = i (i.e., x = y), where gradients are not classically defined for p = 1.
- Impact:
  - The algorithmic update and KSD gradient ascent, as written, are undefined for the p = 1 kernels used in the experiments unless subgradients, diagonals exclusion, or smoothing are explicitly introduced.
- Missing detail:
  - No direct evidence found in the manuscript explaining how non-differentiability is handled (e.g., subgradient definitions, diagonal term removal, mollification, or distributional derivatives). This is critical for correctness of Algorithm 1 and the applicability of the theoretical analysis.

2) Inconsistency in the step-size condition used for the KL descent results
- Evidence:
  - Equation (8) and Lemma 1 (Section 4.1 and 4.2) state
    γ ≤ (α − 1) [α B (1 + ‖∇V(0)‖ + L ∫ ‖x‖ dπ(x) + L √(2 𝓕(μ_0)/λ))]^{-1}.
  - Theorem 3 (Section 4.2) repeats the same bound.
  - Theorem 4 (Appendix B) states a different bound:
    γ ≤ (α − 1) [α B (1 + ‖∇V(0)‖) + L ∫ ‖x‖ dπ(x) + L √(2 𝓕(μ_0)/λ)]^{-1}.
- Problem:
  - The factorization of αB differs: in (8)/Lemma 1/Theorem 3, αB multiplies the entire bracket; in Theorem 4, αB only multiplies (1 + ‖∇V(0)‖) and the L terms are added outside the αB factor. This is a clear internal inconsistency on a critical condition governing the main descent inequality and subsequent convergence claims.
- Impact:
  - The correct admissible range for γ directly affects whether the contraction arguments and iteration complexity bounds are valid.

3) Assumption 3 (uniform boundedness of the feature map and its gradient over all kernel parameters) is not justified for the experimental kernel class
- Evidence:
  - Assumption 3 requires a uniform B such that ‖Φ_θ(x)‖_{ℋ0} ≤ B and ‖∇Φ_θ(x)‖_{ℋ} ≤ B for all x ∈ ℝ^d and θ ∈ Θ (Section 4).
  - Section 5.1 allows dimension-dependent bandwidths h_i without stated constraints on Θ (e.g., lower/upper bounds on h_i).
- Problem:
  - For k_h(x,y) = exp(−|x_i − y_i|/h_i), while k(x,x) = 1 implies a trivial bound on ‖Φ_θ(x)‖, the derivatives of the feature map scale with 1/h_i; as h_i → 0, these derivatives can grow unbounded. Without restricting Θ to ensure h_i remain in a compact set bounded away from 0 (and possibly ∞), a uniform gradient bound B across θ does not hold.
- Impact:
  - The theoretical results in Sections 4 and B require Assumption 3 uniformly over θ. As stated, the experimental kernel class violates this assumption unless θ is constrained, which is not documented. This disconnect undermines the applicability of the convergence theory to the reported experiments.

4) Claim of “unique closed-form solution” for the KSD maximization in multiple-kernel SVGD lacks support
- Evidence:
  - Section 4.2 states: “This formulation is possible when the maximization of the KSD with respect to the kernel parameter has a (unique) closed-form solution. This is actually the case in the multiple-kernel SVGD framework [1] …”
- Problem:
  - No derivation, reference, or explicit formula is provided for this “unique closed-form solution” claim.
- Impact:
  - While tangential to the main method (which uses gradient ascent), this assertion is presented as factual yet lacks evidence. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.

5) Applicability of Appendix B (Stein log-Sobolev inequality) to the chosen kernel class not verified
- Evidence:
  - Appendix B assumes Assumption 5 (generalized Stein log-Sobolev inequality) with max over θ. Section B remarks that only one kernel in the class needs to satisfy it.
- Problem:
  - The manuscript does not provide conditions or examples showing that any kernel in the experimental class satisfies the required inequality.
- Impact:
  - The iteration complexity bounds and KL-convergence guarantees in Appendix B are presented without verification for the kernels actually used. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.

Secondary issues (lower impact)

- Undefined diagonal terms in KSD^2 computation for non-smooth kernels:
  - Equation (4) integrates uπ^k over μ ⊗ μ, which includes diagonal pairs (x = y) for empirical measures. For p = 1 kernels, trace(∇x∇y k(x,x)) is undefined; the manuscript does not specify whether diagonals are excluded or regularized. See Sections: Method (Algorithm 1), Equations (4)–(5), and Section 5.1.

- Minor figure/caption inconsistencies:
  - Covariance matrix heatmaps appear again in the Conclusion (Blocks #40–41) without explicit numbering, while Figure 7 is referenced earlier for the same content (Sections 5.4, Figures 5–7). This is a presentation inconsistency but not material to validity.

Recommendations to resolve
- Replace or smooth the non-differentiable p = 1 kernels (e.g., use p = 2 or introduce differentiable approximations) and document how gradients and Hessians are computed, especially on diagonal particle pairs; alternatively, rigorously define subgradient-based SVGD/KSD steps and justify their use.
- Align the step-size condition across Equation (8), Lemma 1, Theorem 3, and Theorem 4; verify the correct expression from [32] and correct Theorem 4 accordingly.
- Explicitly constrain the kernel parameter space Θ (e.g., h_i ∈ [h_min, h_max] with h_min > 0) to ensure Assumption 3 holds uniformly, and state these constraints in the method and theory sections.
- Provide a derivation or citation for the “unique closed-form solution” claim in the multiple-kernel setting, or soften the claim.
- If invoking Appendix B’s results, verify and state conditions under which at least one kernel in the experimental class satisfies the Stein log-Sobolev inequality.

If these points are addressed, the theoretical analysis and algorithmic specification would better align with the kernels and practices used in the experiments.

If any items above were intentional modeling choices (e.g., subgradient calculus for p = 1), please include the precise definitions and implementation details; currently, no direct evidence was found in the manuscript for such handling.
