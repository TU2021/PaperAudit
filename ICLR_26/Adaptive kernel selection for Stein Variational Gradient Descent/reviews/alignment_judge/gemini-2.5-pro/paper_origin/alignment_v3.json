However, it lists the empirical results as a clear strength, whereas human reviewers remained concerned that the experiments were largely limited to toy or small-scale problems (synthetic/BLR) compared to real-world tasks like BNNs. Review B also raises unique theoretical points about finite-particle analysis and specific calibration metrics."
