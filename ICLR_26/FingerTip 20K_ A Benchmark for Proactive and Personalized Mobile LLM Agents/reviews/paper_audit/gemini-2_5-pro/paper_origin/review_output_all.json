  "baseline_review": "**Summary**This paper introduces FingerTip 20K, a new benchmark designed to evaluate mobile GUI agents on proactive and personalized capabilities, addressing limitations of current reactive, instruction-following paradigms. The authors propose two novel tracks: (1) proactive task suggestion, where an agent predicts a user's intent from contextual cues, and (2) personalized task execution, where an agent executes a task by mimicking a user's preferred action patterns. To support this benchmark, the authors collected a large-scale dataset of 21,437 interaction episodes from 91 real users over two months. This dataset is distinguished by its inclusion of rich user-centric information, such as profiles, location, time, and historical interactions. Experiments on existing generalist and specialized agents reveal significant challenges in these new tasks.

Releasing this protocol would be invaluable for reproducibility.\n    *   For the `Sim2` metric, consider providing a qualitative analysis or examples that illustrate what a higher `Sim2` score looks like in practice. This would help readers better understand the practical significance of the reported improvements.*   **Clarify and Refine the Experimental Setup**\n    *   Please provide more details on how the generalist models were prompted to produce grounded UI actions. This would make the baseline setup more transparent.\n    *   Please provide the exact prompt templates or a more detailed description of how user profile and historical action data were integrated into the prompts for the specialized GUI agents.\n    *   Please correct the inconsistent naming of the CogAgent model across Table 5 and Figure 6.\n    *   Please clarify the fine-tuning procedure: was it one model trained for both tasks, or two separate models as described in the text? The reporting in Table 6 should reflect the correct methodology.*   **Correct All Data Reporting Inconsistencies**\n    *   Please perform a thorough check of all figures and tables to ensure complete consistency. The numerical values in the tables for Figure 6 must be corrected to match the data plotted in the charts (and the results in Tables 4 and 5).\n    *   The presentation of Figure 5 should be clarified. It is recommended to remove the confusing and incomplete table and rely solely on the clearer bar chart, ensuring the text accurately refers to it.*   **Address Methodological and Scholarly Practice Issues**\n    *   Please quantify the portion of the dataset that was repaired using Qwen-VL-Max and discuss the potential impact of this procedure on the evaluation fairness. A better approach would be to exclude these repaired samples from the test set for any model in the Qwen family.\n    *   It is imperative to conduct a thorough review and correction of the entire bibliography. All references must be accurate, valid, and correctly dated. The use of placeholder or fabricated citations is unacceptable.Score\n*   Overall (10): 5 — The paper proposes a novel and important problem, but the execution is marred by severe inconsistencies, methodological issues, and flaws in scholarly practice that require major revision.\n*   Novelty (10): 9 — The proactive and personalized task formulations are new for this domain, and the user-centric, longitudinal data collection concept is a significant and novel contribution.\n*   Technical Quality (10): 4 — The work is severely weakened by major data reporting inconsistencies (Figure 6), potential circularity in dataset creation (Section 4.2), and unvalidated metrics (Section 5.1).\n*   Clarity (10): 6 — While the paper is generally well-motivated, its clarity is significantly undermined by numerous contradictions between the text, tables, and figures (e.g., Figure 3 vs Section 4.2, Table 6 vs Section 5.4).\n*   Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, as the identified issues are based on direct and verifiable evidence within the manuscript."
