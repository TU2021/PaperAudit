  "baseline_review": "1) Summary\nThe paper introduces AgentChangeBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of tool-augmented language model agents to mid-dialogue goal shifts. The benchmark comprises 315 tasks across three enterprise domains (airline, banking, retail), incorporating five distinct user personas. The authors propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework with four novel metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR), Tool Use Efficiency (TUE), Tool-Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR), and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT). Through experiments on several state-of-the-art models, the work demonstrates that traditional success metrics like pass@k can obscure critical performance gaps. For instance, while some models achieve high task success, they may suffer from high redundancy or slow recovery from goal shifts, highlighting the necessity of the proposed fine-grained metrics for realistic agent evaluation.2) Strengths\n*   **Novel and Important Problem Formulation**\n    *   The paper addresses a well-motivated and significant gap in existing LLM agent evaluation: the assumption of static user goals throughout an interaction (Section 1, Section 2).

The recovery rates in Figure 1 seem to be an aggregation of values from Table 10, but this is not clearly stated.\n    *   There are apparent contradictions in reported values. Table 5 lists Claude-3.7-Sonnet's TSR on \"Retail (new)\" as 79.57%. However, Table 9 in the appendix reports its TSR on \"Retail (New)\" as 61.58% and on \"Retail (Old)\" as 79.57%. This discrepancy undermines confidence in the results.\n    *   The relationship between different tables is often unclear. For instance, Table 4 presents overall TSR, while Table 5 focuses on \"new tasks only,\" but the connection to the more detailed breakdown by \"Old\" and \"New\" sets in Table 9 is not explained in the main text.*   **Ambiguity in Metric Definitions and Justifications**\n    *   The weights for the Task Success Rate (TSR) metric (0.25, 0.45, 0.30 in Equation 1) are justified in the appendix as being \"determined through empirical analysis of task importance\" (Appendix, Block 71), but no details of this analysis are provided, making the choice of weights seem arbitrary.\n    *   The parameters for the Tool-Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) metric (a 3-turn window and a batch threshold of 2) are stated without justification (Section 4.3, Appendix, Block 73). It is unclear how sensitive the results are to these specific hyperparameters.\n    *   The `communicate_info_rate` component of TSR is assessed by an \"LLM-as-a-judge\" (Section 4.2), but the paper lacks crucial details about this process, such as the specific prompts, the evaluation rubric, or any measures of inter-rater reliability for the judge model.*   **Limited Scope of \"Goal Shift\" Evaluation**\n    *   The benchmark's primary contribution is evaluating goal shifts, but the current implementation is limited to pre-declared, explicitly signaled sequences defined in the task schema (Section 3.4, Section 5).\n    *   The framework does not yet test more complex and realistic scenarios, such as detecting implicit or ambiguous goal shifts, handling conflicting or interleaved goals, or recovering from incorrect plan execution after a shift.\n    *   While acknowledged as a limitation (Section 5), the constrained nature of the goal shifts should be more clearly framed as a scope definition in the main methodology, as it significantly defines the challenge being measured.*   **Uneven Persona Distribution and Aggregated Analysis**\n    *   The distribution of tasks across the five personas is highly imbalanced, with `MEDIUM_1` assigned more than twice as many tasks as any other persona (Table 8). The justification provided (Section 3.3) is plausible, but this skew may limit the statistical significance of findings related to the less frequent personas.\n    *   The persona-based analysis presented in Table 7 aggregates performance across all models and domains.

Create a main results table in the body of the paper that summarizes the most important metrics (e.g., TSR, TCRR, Recovery Rate) from the appendix tables (e.g., Table 10) for the primary experimental conditions.\n    *   Correct the inconsistencies in the reported numbers, particularly the TSR for Claude-3.7-Sonnet in retail tasks across Table 5 and Table 9. Ensure that all figure captions are self-contained and accurately describe the plotted data and its source (e.g., for Figure 1, explicitly state it shows the recovery rate from Table 10).\n    *   Clearly define the \"Old\" and \"New\" task sets in the main text when first presenting results that distinguish between them, explaining their origin and purpose to the reader.*   **Provide Deeper Justification for Metric Design Choices**\n    *   For the TSR weights in Equation 1, please provide a more concrete justification. This could be a brief summary of the empirical analysis mentioned in the appendix or a more principled argument for why `action_rate` is the most critical component.\n    *   For the TCRR parameters, please explain the rationale for choosing a 3-turn window and a batch threshold of 2.

It is unclear how sensitive the results are to these specific hyperparameters.\n    *   The `communicate_info_rate` component of TSR is assessed by an \"LLM-as-a-judge\" (Section 4.2), but the paper lacks crucial details about this process, such as the specific prompts, the evaluation rubric, or any measures of inter-rater reliability for the judge model.*   **Limited Scope of \"Goal Shift\" Evaluation**\n    *   The benchmark's primary contribution is evaluating goal shifts, but the current implementation is limited to pre-declared, explicitly signaled sequences defined in the task schema (Section 3.4, Section 5).\n    *   The framework does not yet test more complex and realistic scenarios, such as detecting implicit or ambiguous goal shifts, handling conflicting or interleaved goals, or recovering from incorrect plan execution after a shift.\n    *   While acknowledged as a limitation (Section 5), the constrained nature of the goal shifts should be more clearly framed as a scope definition in the main methodology, as it significantly defines the challenge being measured.*   **Uneven Persona Distribution and Aggregated Analysis**\n    *   The distribution of tasks across the five personas is highly imbalanced, with `MEDIUM_1` assigned more than twice as many tasks as any other persona (Table 8). The justification provided (Section 3.3) is plausible, but this skew may limit the statistical significance of findings related to the less frequent personas.\n    *   The persona-based analysis presented in Table 7 aggregates performance across all models and domains. This high-level aggregation may obscure important interactions, such as whether certain models are more robust to the `HARD_1` persona or if persona difficulty varies by domain.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Resolve Critical Inconsistencies and Consolidate Reporting**\n    *   Please resolve the critical contradiction regarding the Gemini recovery rate. Either provide the evidence for the 48.6% figure or remove this result and all related claims from the manuscript (Table 5, Section 4.4.1).\n    *   Please clarify the exact size of the benchmark and ensure the numbers are consistent across the abstract, main text, and appendix tables (e.g., Table 8).\n    *   Correct the inconsistencies in the reported numbers, particularly the TSR for Claude-3.7-Sonnet in retail tasks across Table 5 and Table 9.\n    *   Please revise the results section to present a clearer, more unified narrative. Ensure that all figures are verifiably derivable from their cited source tables and that captions are self-contained and accurate.*   **Align Metric Reporting with Definitions**\n    *   To support claims about recovery speed (e.g., \"fastest\"), please report the GSRT metric in turns, as it is defined in Section 4.3.\n    *   Alternatively, if only recovery rate is measured, please revise the metric's name and definition to reflect this (e.g., \"Goal-Shift Recovery Rate\") and remove all claims related to recovery *speed*.\n    *   Clarify the relationship between the time-based definition and the rate-based reporting to avoid confusion for the reader.*   **Provide Deeper Justification for Metric Design Choices**\n    *   For the TSR weights in Equation 1, please provide a more concrete justification. This could be a brief summary of the empirical analysis mentioned in the appendix or a more principled argument for why `action_rate` is the most critical component.\n    *   For the TCRR parameters, please explain the rationale for choosing a 3-turn window and a batch threshold of 2. If possible, a small sensitivity analysis in the appendix showing how TCRR changes with different window sizes would strengthen this metric.\n    *   To improve the credibility of the `communicate_info_rate` metric, please include the prompt and rubric used for the LLM-as-a-judge in the appendix. Reporting a measure of agreement (e.g., Cohen's kappa) between the LLM judge and a human evaluator on a subset of tasks would be highly beneficial.*   **Acknowledge and Frame the Scope of Goal Shifts More Precisely**\n    *   In the Introduction and Methodology sections, please be more explicit that the current benchmark evaluates an agent's ability to adapt to \"explicit, pre-sequenced goal shifts.\" This will help manage reader expectations and more accurately position the paper's contribution.\n    *   While the discussion in the Limitations section is excellent, bringing this point forward will strengthen the paper by clearly defining the boundaries of the current work, making the contribution more precise.*   **Balance Persona Distribution or Refine Persona-Based Analysis**\n    *   For future work, consider creating a more balanced distribution of tasks across personas to enable more robust comparative analysis.\n    *   For the current paper, the persona analysis could be made more insightful by disaggregating the results in Table 7. For example, showing a breakdown by model would reveal if some models are disproportionately better or worse at handling specific personas (e.g., `HARD_1`), which would be a valuable finding.5) Score\n- Overall (10): 5 — The paper introduces a novel and important benchmark concept, but the manuscript is undermined by critical inconsistencies in the results and dataset description (Table 5 vs. Appendix D.4, Abstract vs. Table 8).\n- Novelty (10): 9 — The explicit focus on evaluating robustness to mid-dialogue goal shifts is a highly novel and important contribution to the field of conversational AI evaluation (Section 1, Section 2).\n- Technical Quality (10): 4 — The work suffers from severe technical flaws, including reporting results for an experiment stated to be un-run and major, unexplained discrepancies in the dataset's size and reported metrics (Table 5 vs. Table 9, Appendix D.4).\n- Clarity (10): 4 — The presentation is deeply confusing due to fragmented, inconsistent, and contradictory reporting of key results and dataset statistics across the main text, tables, and appendix (Abstract, Figure 1, Table 5, Table 8, Table 10).\n- Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, having expertise in LLM evaluation and conversational agents, and I have reviewed the manuscript and its appendix in detail."
