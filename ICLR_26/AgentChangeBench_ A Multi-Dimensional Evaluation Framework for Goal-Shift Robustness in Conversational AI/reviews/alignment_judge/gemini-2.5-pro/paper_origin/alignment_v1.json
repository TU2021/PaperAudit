          "weakness": "The reviews overlap on two major weaknesses (lack of statistical rigor and inconsistent reporting), but diverge significantly elsewhere; Review A criticizes the paper's structure (appendix-heavy) and positioning, while Review B focuses on specific technical flaws like metric definitions (GSRT), recovery criteria, and judge bias.",
          "overall": "While both reviews agree on the paper's strengths, they diverge in their diagnosis of weaknesses and overall judgment, with Review A being more negative and focused on high-level rigor, while Review B is more positive but identifies many specific, fixable technical issues."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the novelty of evaluating goal-shift robustness, the value of the new multi-dimensional metrics (TSR, TUE, etc.), and the realistic multi-domain/persona setup. Review B provides much more granular, evidence-backed detail for the same points, but the substance and prioritization are nearly identical to Review A.",
          "weakness": "The reviews align on broad themes of weakness, such as inconsistent reporting, lack of statistical rigor, and incomplete experiments. However, Review B identifies several major, specific technical flaws absent from Review A (e.g., metric definition conflicts, unvalidated weights, judge bias), while Review A raises a scope limitation (explicit vs. implicit shifts) that Review B misses, resulting in only a moderate match.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, both presenting the work as a promising idea with significant execution flaws that undermine its reliability. While they converge on the paper's core strengths, their critiques of its weaknesses diverge in focus and granularity, with Review B being more technical and internal while Review A is slightly broader."
