          "strength": "Both reviews identify the novel dual-module design, strong empirical results, and model-agnostic practicality as key strengths. However, Review A considers the ROI distillation process a proven strength, whereas Review B highlights its lack of validation as a major weakness, creating a notable point of divergence.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews agree on the use of weak baselines and the lack of quantitative validation for the symbolic rules and ROI distillation. However, they diverge significantly on other points: Review A focuses on higher-level issues like compiler comparisons, while Review B raises more technical concerns like retriever circularity and unsafe code suggestions.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's core contributions and primary strengths, but only moderate alignment on its weaknesses. While both conclude the work is promising but flawed, they emphasize different types of flaws, with Review A being more conceptual and Review B being more technically detailed and critical of the methodology."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the novel approach focusing on optimization rationale, the effective dual-module design, strong empirical results, and the model-agnostic framework as core strengths. Review A also highlights cross-language scalability, a point not explicitly mentioned in Review B, which instead details the rigorous experimental protocol.",
          "weakness": "There is a key overlap in criticizing the manual effort and lack of quantitative validation for the ROI and symbolic rule creation. However, they diverge significantly elsewhere, with Review A focusing on weak baselines and dataset diversity, while Review B raises distinct concerns about dataset comparability, retriever stability, and missing overhead analysis, and they present conflicting views on the compiler optimization comparison.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's core strengths but diverge substantially on its weaknesses, focusing on different aspects of validity (external vs. internal). While both reach a positive overall conclusion, their substantive critiques and priorities for improvement are only partially aligned, with several major points being unique to each review."

However, their focus differs, with high alignment on the paper's strengths but only moderate alignment on its weaknesses, as each review identifies unique and important limitations."
