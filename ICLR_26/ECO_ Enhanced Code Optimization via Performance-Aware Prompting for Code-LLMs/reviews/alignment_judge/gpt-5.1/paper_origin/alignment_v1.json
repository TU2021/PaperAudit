    "explanation": {
      "strength": "Both reviews describe essentially the same core idea and contributions. They agree that ECO is a train-free, model-agnostic, performance-aware prompting framework for code optimization that: (1) distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from slow–fast code pairs; (2) combines a symbolic advisor based on program analysis/CPG rules with an ROI retriever; and (3) yields strong speedups (up to ~7.8x) while largely maintaining correctness across both open- and closed-source LLMs. They both highlight the complementary nature of the two modules (deterministic bottleneck detection plus flexible retrieval), emphasize that ECO avoids simple pattern imitation and instead targets performance reasoning, and note its practicality and cross-model applicability. Review A additionally emphasizes cross-language scalability and robustness (e.g., beam search), while Review B emphasizes careful experimental design and reproducibility, but these are extensions rather than contradictions, hence very high alignment.",
      "weakness": "There is substantial overlap but not perfect alignment. Strongly shared concerns include: (1) ROI distillation reliability/quality – both flag that ROIs are generated by an LLM with no intrinsic quality or fidelity evaluation; (2) lack of quantitative diagnostics for the symbolic advisor – precision/recall or rule coverage are missing; (3) baseline fairness/strength – both note that baselines like Supersonic/SBLLM may be under-optimized or outdated, possibly understating their performance; and (4) questions about external validity/quality of some optimization guidance (e.g., non-standard or questionable C++ examples like VLAs and I/O practices in the appendices). Review A alone stresses: limited dataset diversity and complexity, manual rule/ROI curation and scalability, lack of direct comparison to compiler optimizations, limited exploration on smaller models, and lack of exploration of agent-composition strategies. Review B, in contrast, adds concerns about retriever circularity (using the inference model for E_C), missing statistical significance tests, altered PIE test distribution, and runtime/overhead reporting. Because they agree on some key weaknesses but each also raises substantial distinct issues, alignment on weaknesses is moderate-to-high but not complete.",
      "overall": "In aggregate, the two reviews are highly aligned in their substantive assessment. They converge on the main problem setting (performance-aware code optimization), the novelty (symbolic advisor + ROI retriever, moving beyond pair-based prompting/RAG), and the main empirical takeaway (strong speedups with preserved correctness, broad model applicability). Their positive judgments about the framework’s practicality and conceptual soundness are consistent. On the critical side, they share important concerns around the lack of intrinsic evaluation of ROIs and rule quality, and the strength/fairness of baselines, though Review B offers a more fine-grained set of methodological and engineering critiques while Review A raises broader questions about datasets, scalability, compiler comparisons, and small-model behavior. The overlapping core critiques plus strongly aligned strengths yield a high overall alignment, slightly reduced by the nontrivial set of additional, non-overlapping concerns in each review."

        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews agree on the core motivation: going beyond pattern imitation to performance-aware code optimization via ROIs, combining a symbolic advisor with an ROI retriever in a model-agnostic, no-finetuning framework. They both emphasize strong empirical speedups across models, complementarity of the two modules, and generalization across datasets/languages (though the human explicitly mentions Python and cross-language scalability while the AI highlights Codeforces and detailed measurement rigor). The AI review adds more implementation and evaluation-detail strengths (metrics, gem5, reproducibility) that the human review does not foreground, but these are secondary rather than conflicting.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews question the reliability/validation of the ROI-related components: the human focuses on ROI distillation reliability and potential misidentification of bottlenecks, while the AI calls out lack of quantitative ROI quality/coverage metrics and rule evaluation (precision/recall). They also both flag scalability/maintainability issues around manual rules/ROI curation and, to a lesser extent, retriever stability. However, the human stresses missing comparisons to stronger baselines, dataset diversity (more complex benchmarks), unclear relationship to compiler optimizations, smaller-model scalability, and agent composition strategies—points largely absent from the AI review. Conversely, the AI raises detailed concerns about dataset modifications/comparability, overhead and latency analysis, and specific reporting gaps that the human review does not mention.",
          "overall": "Substantively, the two reviews agree on what ECO is, why it is interesting, and that it is a strong, well-motivated framework with notable empirical gains driven by a symbolic advisor + ROI retriever design. Their main divergence lies in the breadth and granularity of weaknesses: each introduces several important but non-overlapping concerns (baselines/compilers/dataset diversity vs. overhead/comparability/quantitative rule metrics), though they are not contradictory. Overall alignment is high on problem framing, contributions, and general judgment, with moderate gaps on the specific axes of critique."

          "strength": "Both reviews emphasize ECO's core motivation of bridging the gap between correctness and efficiency in code LLMs, highlighting the novel performance-aware prompting, the dual symbolic-advisor/ROI-retriever design, model-agnostic deployment, and strong empirical speedups. The AI review adds more detail on measurement protocol, ablations, and reproducibility, while the human review uniquely stresses cross-language scalability and robustness under beam search.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews point out concerns around the manually curated rule/ROI pipeline and the reliability of the distilled optimization instructions, and they question aspects of evaluation fairness and dataset design. However, the AI review introduces many additional weaknesses (e.g., missing quantitative validation of rules/ROIs, lack of overhead analysis, and numerous reporting inconsistencies) that the human review does not mention, while the human review alone raises issues about comparison to modern baselines, smaller models, and agent composition.",
          "overall": "Overall, the reviews convey a similar high-level judgment: ECO is a novel, impactful framework with solid empirical gains but with notable limitations in how its rule/ROI system and evaluations are validated. Their substantive focus overlaps on the main ideas and on some key limitations, yet the AI review is more exhaustive and critical on methodological and presentation details, leading to only partial but meaningful alignment rather than near-complete agreement."
