Based on a critical review of the manuscript, the following report details clear internal inconsistencies and integrity risks that materially affect the paper's scientific validity and trustworthiness.

### **Integrity Risk and Inconsistency Report**

**1. Contradictory and Misleading Core Illustrative Figure (Figure 1)**

The central motivating figure in the Introduction, Figure 1, contains a significant logical contradiction that misrepresents the performance of the baseline method compared to the proposed ECO framework.

-   **Evidence:** In Figure 1 (Blocks #5, #7), the "Generated Code" produced by the "(Conventional) Code-Pair Retrieval" method (the baseline) is **identical** to the "Generated Code" produced by ECO's "Performance-aware Prompt".
-   **Inconsistency:** Despite the code being the same, the baseline's output is labeled as a failure with the comment `// ✗ O(n²) computation`, while ECO's output is labeled as a success with the comment `// ✓ O(n) computation`.
-   **Factual Error:** The code in question (`for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) { sum += (long long) i * (i + 1) * i / 2; }`) has a time complexity of O(n), not O(n²). Therefore, the annotation for the baseline's output is factually incorrect.
-   **Impact:** This is a major inconsistency. The figure claims to show a clear advantage for ECO over conventional methods, but it does so by presenting the same successful O(n) optimization as both a failure and a success, supported by a factually incorrect comment. This undermines the core argument presented in the introduction.

**2. Contradictory Example of Symbolic Advisor's Logic (Appendix Figure 7)**

An example provided to illustrate a key component of the method, the Symbolic Advisor, is internally inconsistent and misrepresents the component's described functionality.

-   **Evidence:** In Appendix A.2.2, the image version of Figure 7 (Block #46) presents an example of detecting "Suboptimal Data Structure Usage". The "Bottleneck Diagnosis" (C) states: "The following vectors do not use dynamic operations...".
-   **Inconsistency:** However, the corresponding "Input Code" (A) in the same figure contains the line `v.push_back(i*i);`. The `push_back` operation is fundamentally a dynamic operation that modifies the vector's size.
-   **Impact:** The provided evidence directly contradicts the diagnosis claim. This calls into question the correctness of the rules implemented in the Symbolic Advisor and the reliability of the examples used to validate the method's description.

**3. Contradictory Dataset Statistics (Appendix Table 5)**

The statistics for the training datasets presented in the appendix are contradictory, creating ambiguity about the data used.

-   **Evidence:** Table 5 (Block #69) lists two datasets, "PIE-Train" and "PIE-HQ", both with an identical sample count of 4,085.
-   **Inconsistency:** The text in Appendix C (Block #69) explicitly describes the "HQ dataset" as a "high-quality subset of the PIE training data" that has been "pruned". By definition, a pruned subset should be smaller than or equal to the original set. Showing them as identical in size is a contradiction, unless the original set was identical to the HQ set, which would make the description of pruning misleading.
-   **Impact:** This inconsistency raises questions about the precise origin and composition of the training/reference data, which is a cornerstone of the experimental setup.

**4. Minor Numerical Discrepancy in Main Results**

There is a numerical mismatch between results presented in a table and a figure for the same experiment.

-   **Evidence:** The results for the ECO method at Best@1 are reported in two different places:
    1.  Table 2 (Block #24) reports `Best@1 ACC(%)` as **36.27%**.
    2.  Figure 3 (Blocks #30, #33), which the text describes as showing "single-trial generations" (i.e., Best@1), presents data that sums to a total correctness of **34.2%** (sum of "Correct but Not Optimized" at 10.7%, "Optimized" at 10.8%, and "Faster than Human" at 12.7%).
-   **Impact:** While this discrepancy of ~2 percentage points is minor, it points to a lack of care in reporting and verifying the experimental results.

### **Conclusion**

The manuscript contains several high-impact, evidence-based inconsistencies. The most critical issue is the logically flawed and misleading central figure (Figure 1), which uses identical outputs to argue for the superiority of the proposed method over the baseline. This, combined with a contradictory example in the appendix and inconsistent dataset statistics, significantly undermines the trustworthiness and scientific validity of the paper. These issues require clarification and correction before the work can be considered reliable.
