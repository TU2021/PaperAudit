          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions: the extensive empirical evaluation showing task transferability, the practical finding that Binoculars excels at MIA, and the release of the MINT toolkit. While Review A accepts the paper's theoretical proof as a key strength, Review B's assessment of the theory is far more critical, which it details in the weaknesses section.",
          "weakness": "The reviews align on the weakness of saturated performance (ceiling effects) in the experiments, but diverge significantly otherwise. Review B's primary critique is a major technical flaw in the paper's core theorem, which Review A misses entirely. Conversely, Review A criticizes the limited selection of detector methods and the lack of human verification, points not raised by Review B.",
          "overall": "The reviews show moderate alignment, agreeing on the paper's main empirical contributions and the problem of saturated experimental results. However, they diverge substantially in their primary critiques, with Review A focusing on experimental design choices while Review B identifies fundamental flaws in the paper's core theoretical claims, leading to a different focus in their judgments."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core strengths as the theoretical unification of MIA and MGTD, the extensive empirical validation showing transferability, and the release of the MINT benchmark. Review B is more detailed and adds a few secondary strengths, but the primary points are highly consistent with Review A.",
          "weakness": "The reviews have low alignment on weaknesses; Review A focuses on experimental design choices like the limited set of detectors and use of rank correlation, while Review B provides a deep critique of the paper's theoretical rigor and assumptions, points entirely absent from Review A. The only minor overlap is on the issue of saturated performance in experiments.",
          "overall": "The reviews show moderate alignment, as they agree on the paper's main contributions but diverge significantly in their assessment of its flaws. Review A's critique is centered on experimental scope and evaluation choices, while Review B's is a more fundamental challenge to the paper's theoretical claims, leading to different judgments on the paper's limitations."

          "weakness": "The reviews have low alignment on weaknesses; while both note that experimental results are saturated, Review B adds major critiques about the theoretical rigor of the core claims (which Review A saw as a strength), while Review A uniquely points out the limited variety of detectors and lack of human verification.",
          "overall": "The reviews align very well on the paper's contributions and strengths, but diverge significantly on its weaknesses and the validity of the theoretical framework. Review A accepts the theory as a key strength while Review B finds it fundamentally flawed, leading to only moderate overall alignment in judgment despite a shared understanding of the paper's goals."
