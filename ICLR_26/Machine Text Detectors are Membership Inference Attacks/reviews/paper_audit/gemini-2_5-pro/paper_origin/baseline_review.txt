1) Summary
This paper investigates the relationship between Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) and Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD), arguing they are fundamentally similar tasks that have been studied in separate communities. The authors provide a theoretical unification, proving that the likelihood ratio test is asymptotically optimal for both tasks. They frame a large number of existing methods from both fields as approximations of this optimal test. Through large-scale experiments on 12 methods across 13 domains and 10 generators, the authors demonstrate a strong performance correlation (Spearman's ρ > 0.6) between the two tasks. A key finding is that Binoculars, a state-of-the-art MGTD method, also achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks. To facilitate future cross-task research, the authors introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite.2) Strengths
*   **Novel and Impactful Thesis:** The paper's central claim—that MIAs and MGTD are two sides of the same coin—is a novel and important contribution. It challenges the siloed research in these areas and encourages a more unified approach, which could accelerate progress in both.
    *   The introduction clearly motivates this gap by highlighting the independent development of nearly identical methods like Neighborhood attack and DetectGPT (Section 1, Section 2.2).
    *   The conclusion calls for "greater cross-task awareness and collaboration" (Abstract, Section 5), a direct and impactful implication of the work.
    *   The release of the MINT unified evaluation suite provides a concrete tool for the community to act on this thesis (Abstract).*   **Strong Theoretical Unification:** The paper provides a principled theoretical framework that formally connects the two tasks. This goes beyond prior work that only noted anecdotal similarities between specific methods.
    *   Theorem 2.3 proves that the likelihood ratio test is asymptotically optimal for both MIA and MGTD, providing a shared theoretical foundation.
    *   The classification of existing methods as either "Approximation via External Reference" or "Approximation via Text Sampling" is a valuable conceptual contribution that organizes a disparate set of techniques under a single lens (Section 2.4).
    *   Table 1 effectively demonstrates how 13 different methods can be reformulated to fit this unified framework, making the theoretical claim concrete and easy to understand.*   **Comprehensive and Rigorous Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental setup is extensive and robust, providing strong evidence for the paper's claims of transferability.
    *   The study includes a large number of methods (7 MIA, 5 MGTD, plus 4 baselines) (Section 3.1, Table 1).
    *   The evaluation is conducted on large-scale, established benchmarks for both tasks (MIMIR for MIA, RAID for MGTD), covering numerous domains and model sizes (Section 3.1).
    *   The use of Spearman's rank correlation is an appropriate and effective way to quantify the primary claim of performance transferability (Figure 2).
    *   Experiments are conducted in both white-box and black-box settings, demonstrating the relevance of the findings to different real-world scenarios (Section 3.2, Figure 3).*   **Compelling and Surprising Key Finding:** The paper presents a clear, practical demonstration of its thesis by showing that a method from one field can achieve state-of-the-art results in the other.
    *   The finding that Binoculars, an MGTD method, outperforms all tested MIA methods on the MIMIR MIA benchmark is a powerful and surprising result (Figure 3, Section 3.2).
    *   This result directly supports the claim that "current evaluations in MIAs may be biased by overlooking stronger methods from machine text detection" (Section 3.2).
    *   The similarity in score distributions between top-performing methods from each field (Min-K%++ and Binoculars) further reinforces their fundamental connection (Figure 1).*   **Nuanced Analysis of Outliers:** The authors strengthen their argument by analyzing a case of limited transferability, which demonstrates a deep understanding of the tasks' subtle differences.
    *   The paper identifies Zlib as a method that performs well on MIA but poorly on MGTD (Figure 2, Section 3.3).
    *   The analysis in Section 3.3 and Figure 4 provides a convincing explanation: the priors are different. In MIA, both classes are human text, while in MGTD, machine text is systematically more compressible, which confounds the Zlib metric. This thoughtful analysis adds credibility to the overall thesis.3) Weaknesses
*   **Clarity of Theoretical Assumptions and Practical Relevance:** The core theoretical result (Theorem 2.3) relies on strong asymptotic assumptions that may not hold in practical LLM training scenarios, and the implications of this gap are not fully explored.
    *   The theorem statement refers to "standard asymptotic regularity conditions" (Block #11) without explicitly defining them in the main text.
    *   The proof for membership inference relies on the model's likelihood `P_M(x)` converging to the true likelihood of `x` being a training member, which assumes "infinite training samples" (Block #12). This is a significant idealization, as real-world models are often trained for a single epoch on a finite dataset.
    *   While a remark acknowledges this limitation (Block #14), the main discussion does not sufficiently address the potential disconnect between the asymptotic theory and the finite-sample, single-pass reality of LLM pre-training.*   **Incomplete Theoretical Framework:** The proposed likelihood ratio framework, while elegant, does not encompass all the methods tested, including some of the top-performing ones.
    *   The authors explicitly state that metrics like DC-PDD and Min-k% "fall outside of our core framing" (Section 2.5).
    *   Min-K% and Min-K%++ are among the best-performing MIA methods and transfer reasonably well (Figure 2, Figure 3), yet the theory does not explain their success or connection to the likelihood ratio principle.
    *   This gap between the theory and the empirical results for some key methods leaves the unification story feeling incomplete.*   **Oversimplified Presentation of Main Results:** The primary results in the main paper are presented as average AUROC scores, which obscures performance variance and robustness across different settings.
    *   Figure 3 uses simple bar charts showing the mean performance averaged over all domains and models for each task. This makes it difficult to assess how consistently one method outperforms another.
    *   For example, while Binoculars has the highest average MIA score, the chart does not show if this holds for all model sizes or domains, or if its performance has high variance.
    *   While full results are available in the appendix (Tables 2, 3, 4), including a measure of variance (e.g., error bars or box plots) in the main figure would provide a more complete and honest picture of the methods' relative performance.*   **Lack of Computational Cost Analysis:** The paper compares numerous methods on performance without a systematic discussion of their computational efficiency, a critical factor for practical application.
    *   Methods like Neighborhood and DetectGPT require generating and scoring many text perturbations, making them significantly more expensive than single-pass methods like Loss, Zlib, or Binoculars (Appendix A).
    *   The paper makes claims about the "practical impact of the transferability" (Abstract), but without a cost-benefit analysis, it is difficult for a reader to make informed decisions about which method to use.
    *   No direct evidence found in the manuscript for a comparison of computational costs.4) Suggestions for Improvement
*   **Refine and Contextualize Theoretical Claims:** To improve clarity and manage expectations about the theory's applicability, the authors should be more explicit about its underlying assumptions.
    *   In the statement of Theorem 2.3, briefly enumerate the key assumptions (e.g., model as a maximum likelihood estimator, convergence under infinite data) instead of relying on the general phrase "standard asymptotic regularity conditions."
    *   Expand the remark in Block #14 into a short paragraph in Section 2.5, discussing the potential implications of the theory-practice gap (e.g., why non-asymptotic or heuristic methods might still be competitive).*   **Discuss Methods Outside the Unification Framework:** The authors should briefly discuss the high-performing methods that do not fit their proposed framework to provide a more complete picture.
    *   In Section 2.5, add a few sentences hypothesizing why methods like Min-K%++ work well. For example, could they be viewed as approximating a different, but related, statistical test that focuses on "outlier" tokens as evidence of non-membership, rather than the overall likelihood?
    *   This would demonstrate a deeper engagement with the full landscape of methods and acknowledge the limitations of the current theoretical model.*   **Enhance Visualization of Results:** The main results figure should be updated to include information about performance variance.
    *   In Figure 3, replace the current bar charts with box plots that show the distribution of AUROC scores across the different domains and models for each method.
    *   Alternatively, add error bars to the existing bars representing the standard deviation of performance. This would allow readers to better judge the stability and robustness of each method's performance.*   **Incorporate Computational Cost Analysis:** To improve the practical utility of the paper, the authors should add a discussion of the methods' computational complexity.
    *   Add a column to Table 1 indicating the relative computational cost of each method (e.g., number of forward passes required per sample).
    *   Include a brief paragraph in the analysis (Section 3.3) discussing the performance-vs-efficiency trade-offs. For instance, it could be noted that Binoculars is not only the top performer but also one of the most efficient methods, further strengthening its position.5) Score
