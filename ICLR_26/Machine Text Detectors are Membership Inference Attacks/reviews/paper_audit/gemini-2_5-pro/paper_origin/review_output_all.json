This invalidates the proof of optimality for the proposed statistic (Section 2.3).\n    *   This theoretical claim is contradicted by the paper's own classification of methods. Table 1 shows that top-performing approximations like Reference and DetectGPT are based on a *difference* of NLLs (e.g., `L(x;M) - L(x;M_ref)`), which correctly approximates the true log-likelihood ratio, not the ratio of NLLs proposed in the theorem.\n    *   The theorem statement refers to \"standard asymptotic regularity conditions\" (Section 2.3) without explicitly defining them in the main text.

This makes it difficult to assess how consistently one method outperforms another. For example, while Binoculars has the highest average MIA score, the chart does not show if this holds for all model sizes or domains.\n    *   The paper silently omits the `DetectGPT` method from the main visualizations (Figure 2, Figure 3), despite listing it as a tested method (Section 3.1) and showing its (identical to `Neighborhood`) results in the appendix (Tables 2, 3, 4). This lack of explanation could cause confusion.\n    *   While full results are available in the appendix (Tables 2, 3, 4), including a measure of variance (e.g., error bars or box plots) in the main figure would provide a more complete and honest picture of the methods' relative performance.*   **Lack of Computational Cost Analysis:** The paper compares numerous methods on performance without a systematic discussion of their computational efficiency, a critical factor for practical application.\n    *   Methods like Neighborhood and DetectGPT require generating and scoring many text perturbations, making them significantly more expensive than single-pass methods like Loss, Zlib, or Binoculars (descriptions in Appendix A).\n    *   The paper makes claims about the \"practical impact of the transferability\" (Abstract), but without a cost-benefit analysis, it is difficult for a reader to make informed decisions about which method to use.\n    *   No direct evidence found in the manuscript for a systematic comparison of computational costs.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Correct and Clarify the Theoretical Framework:** To improve the technical soundness of the paper, the authors should correct the core theorem and be more explicit about its assumptions.\n    *   Revise Theorem 2.3 to use the correct log-likelihood ratio statistic, which is based on a *difference* of NLLs (e.g., `L(x;Q) - L(x;M)`).\n    *   This correction would resolve the internal contradiction where the methods in Table 1 correctly use a difference-based formulation while the theorem incorrectly proposes a ratio-based one.\n    *   In the statement of Theorem 2.3, briefly enumerate the key assumptions (e.g., model as a maximum likelihood estimator, convergence under infinite data) instead of relying on the general phrase \"standard asymptotic regularity conditions.\"*   **Discuss Methods Outside the Unification Framework:** The authors should briefly discuss the high-performing methods that do not fit their proposed framework to provide a more complete picture.\n    *   In Section 2.5, add a few sentences hypothesizing why methods like Min-K%++ work well.

For example, while Binoculars has the highest average MIA score, the chart does not show if this holds for all model sizes or domains.\n    *   The paper silently omits the `DetectGPT` method from the main visualizations (Figure 2, Figure 3), despite listing it as a tested method (Section 3.1) and showing its (identical to `Neighborhood`) results in the appendix (Tables 2, 3, 4). This lack of explanation could cause confusion.\n    *   While full results are available in the appendix (Tables 2, 3, 4), including a measure of variance (e.g., error bars or box plots) in the main figure would provide a more complete and honest picture of the methods' relative performance.*   **Lack of Computational Cost Analysis:** The paper compares numerous methods on performance without a systematic discussion of their computational efficiency, a critical factor for practical application.\n    *   Methods like Neighborhood and DetectGPT require generating and scoring many text perturbations, making them significantly more expensive than single-pass methods like Loss, Zlib, or Binoculars (descriptions in Appendix A).\n    *   The paper makes claims about the \"practical impact of the transferability\" (Abstract), but without a cost-benefit analysis, it is difficult for a reader to make informed decisions about which method to use.\n    *   No direct evidence found in the manuscript for a systematic comparison of computational costs.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Correct and Clarify the Theoretical Framework:** To improve the technical soundness of the paper, the authors should correct the core theorem and be more explicit about its assumptions.\n    *   Revise Theorem 2.3 to use the correct log-likelihood ratio statistic, which is based on a *difference* of NLLs (e.g., `L(x;Q) - L(x;M)`).\n    *   This correction would resolve the internal contradiction where the methods in Table 1 correctly use a difference-based formulation while the theorem incorrectly proposes a ratio-based one.\n    *   In the statement of Theorem 2.3, briefly enumerate the key assumptions (e.g., model as a maximum likelihood estimator, convergence under infinite data) instead of relying on the general phrase \"standard asymptotic regularity conditions.\"*   **Discuss Methods Outside the Unification Framework:** The authors should briefly discuss the high-performing methods that do not fit their proposed framework to provide a more complete picture.\n    *   In Section 2.5, add a few sentences hypothesizing why methods like Min-K%++ work well. For example, could they be viewed as approximating a different, but related, statistical test that focuses on \"outlier\" tokens as evidence of non-membership, rather than the overall likelihood?\n    *   This would demonstrate a deeper engagement with the full landscape of methods and acknowledge the limitations of the current theoretical model.*   **Enhance Visualization and Reporting of Results:** The main results figures and text should be updated to include information about performance variance and clarify the set of tested methods.\n    *   In Figure 3, replace the current bar charts with box plots or add error bars to show the distribution of AUROC scores across the different domains and models for each method.\n    *   Add a brief note in the experimental setup (Section 3.1) or figure captions explaining that `DetectGPT` was omitted from main figures because its performance is identical to `Neighborhood`, to ensure full transparency.*   **Incorporate Computational Cost Analysis:** To improve the practical utility of the paper, the authors should add a discussion of the methods' computational complexity.\n    *   Add a column to Table 1 indicating the relative computational cost of each method (e.g., number of forward passes required per sample).\n    *   Include a brief paragraph in the analysis (Section 3.3) discussing the performance-vs-efficiency trade-offs. For instance, it could be noted that Binoculars is not only the top performer but also one of the most efficient methods, further strengthening its position.5) Score\n*   Overall (10): 7 — The paper presents a novel and impactful thesis with strong empirical support, but a core theoretical claim is based on a flawed proof.\n*   Novelty (10): 9 — The conceptual unification of MIA and MGTD and the large-scale study of transferability are highly novel and insightful.\n*   Technical Quality (10): 6 — The empirical methodology is rigorous, but the central theoretical proof is incorrect and there are minor inconsistencies in the experimental reporting (Theorem 2.3, Figure 3).\n*   Clarity (10): 8 — The paper is generally well-written, but the flawed theorem and the unexplained omission of a method from key figures reduce clarity.\n*   Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment as the topic is within my area of expertise and the paper provides sufficient detail for a thorough evaluation."
