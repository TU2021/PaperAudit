Academic Integrity and Consistency Risk Report

Scope of review
This report flags high-impact internal inconsistencies, numerical mismatches, and missing/contradictory details that materially affect the manuscript’s validity. Every point below is anchored to specific locations (section/table/figure).

Key issues

1) Contradiction: claimed negative correlation with turn count vs. reported accuracies
- Evidence (Appendix B, “Key Findings” under Turn Complexity and Error Pattern Analysis):
  • “Performance Degradation: Clear negative correlation between turn count and accuracy; Average drop: ~15–20% from single-turn to 6+ turns.”
- Contradictory data (Appendix B, Table 8; also duplicated table below it):
  • For all six models, Medium (5–6 turns) accuracy is higher than Single/Dual (1–2 turns). Examples: kimi-k2 0.54 → 0.62, claude-sonnet-4 0.56 → 0.61, deepseek-v3.1 0.51 → 0.61, gemini-2.5-flash 0.48 → 0.56, gpt-4.1 0.46 → 0.51, Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 0.42 → 0.49 (Table 8).
  • The same appendix text acknowledges a rebound at Long (≥7 turns): “performance rebounds in the Long bin (≥7 turns, +20 pp on average).”
- Impact: The narrative asserts a degradation with more turns that is not supported by the provided accuracy tables; this undermines claims about “peak complexity” and the prescribed operational guidance.

2) Inconsistent dataset-average accuracy for Attack600
- Evidence (Section 4.4, Table 4):
  • Avg. Accuracy for ATTACK600 = 24.3%.
- Contradiction (Appendix, Figure 6 “Dataset Characteristics” panel):
  • Mean Score for Attack600 reported as 0.34.
- Context check (Figure 1/Block 27 per-model Attack600 accuracies are 0.162, 0.292, 0.200, 0.328, 0.320, 0.215; their mean is ~0.253, consistent with Table 4, not 0.34).
- Impact: A 10.7 percentage-point discrepancy for Attack600’s mean accuracy materially affects conclusions about dataset difficulty and heterogeneity.

3) Risk–coverage direction mismatch
- Evidence (Appendix, Figure 8 and Figure 73):
  • Plotted risk–coverage curves show risk increasing with coverage (as more, lower-confidence items are accepted). AURC rankings match Table 5 and Appendix Table in Figure 7.
- Contradiction (Appendix, Block 72 “Coverage | Risk (Error Rate)” numeric table):
  • The numeric table lists risk decreasing as coverage increases (0.0 → 0.7 down to 1.0 → 0.2), which is opposite to the plotted behavior and standard selective prediction dynamics.
- Impact: Conflicting quantitative descriptions of risk–coverage behavior can mislead deployment guidance and invalidate AURC interpretations.

4) Turn-count distribution conflicts across appendices
- Evidence (Appendix B, “Turn Distribution in Dataset”):
  • Counts: 10 turns ~5; 9 ~10; 8 ~25; 7 ~50; 6 ~200; 5 ~900; 4 ~1000; 3 ~150; 2 ~100; 1 ~50.
- Contradiction (Appendix C, panel (d) “Relationship: Turns vs Length” table):
  • For 10 turns: “Count ~800”; for 8 turns: “~400”; for 6 turns: “~300”, etc.
- Impact: These contradictory counts (e.g., 10 turns ~5 vs. ~800) directly affect any analysis of length/turn effects and cast doubt on the reliability of stratified findings.

5) Unexplained and inconsistent tabular column in Figure 1 block
- Evidence (Section 4.4/Block 27 table preceding Figure 1):
  • A rightmost “Accuracy” column lists values 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 for rows Attack600, 1K, MHJ, without definition or consistency with the row-wise accuracies. The caption of Figure 1 does not explain this extra column.
- Impact: This extraneous, unexplained column introduces confusion and risks misinterpretation of per-dataset performance.

Secondary observations (less critical, but worth clarifying)
- Appendix C “Relationship: Turns vs Length” numbers for “Transcript Length (characters)” and “Count” appear stylized/approximate and conflict with the histogram in Appendix Figure 62 showing heavy left mass (<2k) and very sparse extreme lengths; clear provenance or method for these approximations is missing.
- Minor rounding inconsistency: Figure 1 caption notes Attack600 maximum “0.333” whereas the table cells show a maximum of 0.328; while small, it would be better to align exact reported values. No direct evidence of impact beyond presentation.

Recommendations to resolve
- Align the turn-count narrative with empirical tables: revise Appendix B “Key Findings” to accurately reflect Table 8 (increase at 5–6 turns and rebound at ≥7 turns) or correct Table 8 if it is wrong.
- Recompute and reconcile dataset-level averages; ensure Table 4 and Appendix Figure 6 report the same Attack600 mean accuracy, with clear methodology (across models, same τ*).
- Fix the risk–coverage numeric table (Block 72) to match plotted curves and the definition used for AURC; document computation order (sorting by confidence, coverage definition).
- Standardize turn-count distributions: pick one authoritative source, provide exact counts, and remove approximate conflicting tables or mark them clearly as illustrative (non-data).
- Remove or explain the extraneous “Accuracy” column in Block 27 table; ensure Figure 1’s data presentation is consistent and unambiguous.

Conclusion
The manuscript presents a clearly structured benchmark and extensive results, but the issues above represent substantive internal inconsistencies and numerical conflicts that materially affect interpretability and trust. Addressing them is necessary to ensure scientific correctness and reproducibility.

If corrected, the broader conclusions (model ranking, calibration differences, high-confidence error risks) would likely remain, but current discrepancies weaken the evidential basis.
