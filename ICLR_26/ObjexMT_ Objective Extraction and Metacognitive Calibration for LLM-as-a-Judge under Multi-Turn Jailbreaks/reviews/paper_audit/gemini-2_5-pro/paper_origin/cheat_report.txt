Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several internal inconsistencies and issues affecting the paper's scientific validity and trustworthiness were identified.

### **Summary of Findings**

The manuscript contains significant internal contradictions, particularly in the appendix, where the textual interpretation of results is directly refuted by the data presented in the accompanying tables and figures. Additionally, the abstract uses statistical terminology in a misleading way, potentially misrepresenting a key finding.

### **1. Contradiction Between Textual Analysis and Data in Turn Complexity Analysis (Appendix B)**

The textual summary of the turn complexity analysis in Appendix B makes claims that are directly contradicted by the data in Table 8 and Figure 4 within the same section.

*   **Inconsistent Claim about Performance Drop:**
    *   **Claim (Block 48):** "Accuracy drops by roughly **15–20 pp** from the Single/Dual to Medium bins across all six systems..." (The "Medium" bin is defined as 5-6 turns).
    *   **Evidence (Table 8, Block 49):** The data in Table 8 shows the opposite trend. For every model, accuracy *increases* from the "1–2" turn bin to the "5–6" turn bin. For example:
        *   `kimi-k2`: 0.54 → 0.62 (**+8 pp**)
        *   `claude-sonnet-4`: 0.56 → 0.61 (**+5 pp**)
        *   `gpt-4.1`: 0.46 → 0.51 (**+5 pp**)
    *   This represents a direct and material contradiction between the authors' interpretation and their reported results. While a performance drop does occur from the "1-2" turn bin to the "3-4" turn bin, its magnitude (1-13 pp) is smaller than the claimed "15-20 pp".

*   **Inconsistent Claim about Peak Error Rate:**
    *   **Claim (Block 49):** "Error-rate bars in Fig. 4 (lower left) show the peak at 5–6 turns..."
    *   **Evidence (Figure 4, "Error Rate by Turn Count" plot, Block 51):** The plot shows that for most models, the error rate peaks at **3 or 4 turns**, not 5-6 turns. The error rates for 5-6 turns are visibly lower than for 3-4 turns.

These inconsistencies undermine the conclusions drawn in Appendix B regarding the impact of turn complexity, suggesting a significant error in the analysis or interpretation of the results.

### **2. Misleading Use of Statistical Terminology in the Abstract**

The abstract uses the term "variance" in a non-standard and potentially misleading way to describe the range of results.

*   **Claim (Abstract, Block 2):** "...striking dataset heterogeneity (16–82% accuracy variance) reveals that automated obfuscation poses fundamental challenges..."
*   **Evidence (Figure 1, Block 27/29):** The reported accuracy scores across all models and datasets *range* from 0.162 (16.2%) for `gpt-4.1` on `Attack600` to 0.857 (85.7%) for `kimi-k2` on `MHJ`. The numbers "16%" and "82%" appear to refer to the approximate lower and upper bounds of this range.
*   **Evidence (Appendix Figure 6, Block 65/71):** The manuscript presents an analysis titled "Performance Variance by Dataset," which reports the statistical variance of accuracy for each dataset. The values are approximately 0.003 to 0.004.
*   **Inconsistency:** Using the term "variance" to describe a *range* of values is statistically incorrect and misrepresents the finding. The actual variance is orders of magnitude smaller than the reported "16-82%". This phrasing could mislead readers into misinterpreting the scale and nature of the dataset heterogeneity.

### **3. Redundant and Confusing Data Presentation in Appendix B**

The data presentation in Appendix B is disorganized, containing duplicated tables and a mix of precise and imprecise data representations that create confusion.

*   **Evidence (Block 49):** The appendix block contains four separate tables related to turn complexity.
    *   The first table is labeled "Table 8: Objective-extraction accuracy by turn category...".
    *   The second table, immediately following, is labeled "Accuracy by Turn Category" and contains data identical to Table 8.
    *   The third and fourth tables ("Performance vs Conversation Length" and "Error Rate by Turn Count") present approximate values (e.g., `~0.5`, `~0.4`) that appear to be manual transcriptions of the plots in Figure 4.
*   **Impact:** This redundant and inconsistent presentation format detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the analysis. When combined with the major interpretive errors noted in Point 1, it raises concerns about the overall rigor of this section of the manuscript.
