      "strength": "Both reviews converge strongly on the core motivation and contributions. They agree that the paper introduces ObjexMT as a benchmark/protocol to test LLM-as-a-Judge systems on (1) extracting latent objectives from adversarial multi-turn jailbreak conversations and (2) calibrating self-reported confidence. Both highlight: the safety/reliability relevance of evaluating LLM judges; the dual focus on semantic similarity / objective extraction plus confidence calibration; the use of multiple models and adversarial datasets with varying obfuscation levels; and the practical implications for confidence-based gating and human oversight. The AI review goes into more technical detail (metrics, statistics, dataset breakdown), but these are elaborations of the same core strengths and motivations identified in the human review rather than a different perspective.",
      "weakness": "There is partial but not full alignment on weaknesses. Overlaps include: concerns about reliance on a single LLM judge for semantic similarity (and its potential bias) and dataset/schema heterogeneity influencing difficulty. However, the human review emphasizes points the AI review does not: (a) the conceptual over-claim of calling this 'metacognition' instead of more precise 'confidence calibration'; (b) methodological concerns about threshold selection on N=300 from the same dataset framed as multiple-comparison/overfitting risk and the absence of cross-validation; (c) lack of inter-annotator agreement reporting for the calibration set; and (d) insufficient validation that self-reported confidence is a good proxy compared to probability-based measures. The AI review instead foregrounds other, more technical limitations (single judge being also an evaluated model; lack of multi-judge/threshold sensitivity analyses; lack of post-hoc calibration; constraints from single-sentence objectives; minor appendix formatting issues). These are related in spirit to some human concerns about calibration and robustness, but the concrete criticisms only partially overlap.",
      "overall": "In aggregate, the reviews are quite aligned in their overall substantive picture: both see this as a well-motivated, practically relevant benchmark that advances evaluation of LLM judges on latent objective extraction plus confidence calibration, with thorough experiments and useful safety implications, but with notable methodological limitations around evaluation design and robustness. The AI review is more granular and technically detailed, and it raises several weaknesses not mentioned by the human reviewer, while the human reviewer raises conceptual framing and annotation/thresholding issues that the AI review does not. Because the shared high-level assessment and key strengths match closely, but the detailed weakness sets only partially intersect, the overall content alignment is high but not complete."

They also share overlapping strengths such as clear task formulation, transparent threshold calibration, comprehensive multi-model experiments, dataset diversity, and practical safety implications. Review B adds more granularity but does not contradict Review A.",

Review B introduces many additional granular issues (e.g., fairness to safety-tuned refusals, reporting inconsistencies, judge bias) that do not appear in Review A, reducing alignment but not contradicting it.",
          "overall": "The two reviews share the same broad assessment of the paper’s contributions and limitations, with Review B offering a much more detailed and technical breakdown. Despite the extra detail, the substantive judgments are generally consistent, yielding high but not perfect alignment."

          "strength": "Both reviews agree that the central contribution is a benchmark for latent objective extraction and confidence calibration for LLM-as-a-judge systems in adversarial jailbreak settings, evaluated via semantic similarity and calibration metrics. They also both highlight multi-model, multi-dataset experiments, artifact release, and practical safety guidance such as confidence-based gating and human oversight. The AI review additionally emphasizes task formalization, statistical testing, and various auxiliary analyses that the human review omits, but these extend rather than contradict the human reviewer’s view.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews criticize the calibration pipeline, noting the small human calibration set, the use of a single global similarity threshold, and the absence of inter-annotator agreement, and they share concerns about relying solely on self-reported confidence without comparing to probability-based uncertainty measures. However, the AI review introduces many additional critiques—single-judge dependence, narrow confidence elicitation design, dataset and label validity issues, reporting inconsistencies, limited model coverage, and fairness to safety behavior—that the human review does not discuss, while the human review uniquely challenges the ‘metacognition’ framing and the clarity of the claimed contributions and asks for deeper explanation of dataset performance disparities.",
          "overall": "Both reviews portray the work as an important and generally valuable benchmark with meaningful safety implications but notable methodological limitations, so their overall judgments and focus are directionally aligned. They converge on the core story of what ObjexMT does, why it matters, and where its main risks lie, while the AI review provides a much more exhaustive and fine-grained critique that goes beyond the human review. This yields high but not near-perfect substantive alignment between the two assessments."
