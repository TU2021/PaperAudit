However, the substantive alignment is reduced by the significant divergence in the identified weaknesses, with Review B providing a more methodologically focused critique."

          "weakness": "The reviews overlap on key weaknesses like the lack of inter-annotator agreement, the limited calibration set, and the narrowness of confidence measurement, but Review B identifies several additional major issues, such as the single-judge evaluation bias and lack of stochastic decoding, which are absent in Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews agree on the paper's central contribution and its importance, but they diverge in the breadth of their critiques, with Review B offering a more comprehensive and methodologically rigorous assessment of the paper's limitations, resulting in only a moderate overall alignment."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core contribution as a novel benchmark for latent objective extraction and confidence calibration, highlighting its importance for AI safety and the value of the comprehensive experiments and released artifacts. Review B adds more granular praise for the statistical rigor and specific sub-analyses, but the main points are highly aligned.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on several weaknesses, including the threshold optimization, the lack of inter-annotator agreement, and the narrow validation of confidence measures. However, Review B identifies multiple additional major concerns missed by Review A, such as the bias from using a single LLM judge and the penalization of safety-tuned models, creating a notable gap.",
          "overall": "The reviews align strongly on the paper's primary strengths and its overall positive contribution, but they diverge significantly in their critique, with Review B offering a much more thorough and methodologically-focused set of weaknesses. This results in a moderately high alignment, as their top-level judgment is similar but their critical reasoning only partially overlaps."
