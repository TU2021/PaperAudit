          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions: a novel, training-free GSP framework for interpretability, its broad multilingual application, statistical rigor, and causal head ablations. However, they directly contradict on the motivation for the Fiedler value, which Review A sees as a weakness while Review B considers it a theoretically grounded strength.",
          "weakness": "There is strong overlap on critiques of the weak empirical results, underdeveloped causal analysis, and poor figure quality. However, Review B identifies several major technical issues missed by Review A (flawed head aggregation, inconsistent sample sizes), while Review A's primary weakness (poor motivation) is absent from Review B.",
          "overall": "The reviews agree on the paper's main topics but diverge in focus and judgment; Review A critiques high-level motivation and clarity, while Review B offers a deeper technical critique with specific methodological flaws. This difference in focus, along with a direct contradiction on a core concept, results in only partial substantive alignment."

Review B additionally highlights the tokenizer-stress analysis as a key contribution, a point not mentioned by Review A, but the primary strengths are highly aligned.",
          "weakness": "There is very high alignment on weaknesses, with both reviews criticizing the weak theoretical justification for the Fiedler value, the over-interpretation of inconsistent empirical results, the under-specified causal ablations, and the preliminary nature of practical applications. Review B adds more detailed points on reproducibility and confounding factors, but the core critiques are nearly identical.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, agreeing that the paper presents a novel and promising idea but is undermined by significant flaws in its theoretical grounding and empirical execution. While Review B is much more detailed, its core assessment of the paper's value and limitations is substantively the same as Review A's."

Review B provides a more detailed critique, adding an important weakness about uncontrolled confounds (e.g., tokenization) that Review A does not mention.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in substance and judgment, agreeing that the paper presents a novel idea with flawed execution and unsubstantiated claims. Both focus on the same core strengths (novel framework) and weaknesses (weak theory, weak empiricals), leading to a consistent overall assessment. The main divergence is that Review B is more detailed and identifies a few additional points that are absent in Review A."
