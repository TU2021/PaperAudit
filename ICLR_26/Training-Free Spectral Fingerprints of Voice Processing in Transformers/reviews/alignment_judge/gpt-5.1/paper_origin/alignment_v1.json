      "strength": "Both reviews converge on the core motivation and contributions. They agree that the paper proposes a training-free, graph-signal/spectral framework applied to attention-induced token graphs in transformers, centered on the Fiedler value to capture algebraic connectivity. Both emphasize: (i) interpretability/diagnostic lens on transformer computation; (ii) focus on voice alternation (active/passive) as the main syntactic phenomenon; (iii) multilingual scope across ~20 languages and three model families; (iv) detection of model-family-specific ‘computational fingerprints’, including an English-specific disruption in Phi-3 and smaller, more distributed or muted effects in Qwen and LLaMA; (v) links between spectral connectivity and behavioral outcomes; and (vi) causal evidence via attention head ablations. Review B adds more detail (tokenizer stress, directed Laplacians, reasoning generalization), but these are refinements that are broadly compatible with the strengths named in Review A. Hence alignment on the high-level motivation and positive aspects is strong, though not perfect.",
      "weakness": "The overlap on weaknesses is moderate but not tight. Review A focuses on conceptual and interpretive concerns: unclear motivation and theoretical justification for using the Fiedler value, weakly convincing empirical results (especially small/inconsistent effects for some models and overstatement of findings), unclear head-ablation methodology and causal claims, underdeveloped practical applications (e.g., hallucination detection), and poor accessibility/figure readability. Review B, in contrast, largely accepts the Fiedler choice as theoretically sound and emphasizes different technical issues: potential degeneracy of mass-weighted head aggregation to uniform weights, inconsistent sample-size reporting and power claims, possible overinterpretation of very strong correlations without multivariate controls, narrative–figure mismatches (particularly for Qwen), incomplete ablation details/statistics, and preliminary/under-described reasoning extensions. There is some intersection: both note issues with clarity and figures (small or hard-to-read effects), and both question aspects of the causal/ablation analysis and the interpretation/strength of empirical effects (especially when small or potentially noisy). However, Review A’s central criticism that the theoretical grounding and overall utility are weak is not echoed by Review B, which instead praises the theory and framing. Similarly, Review B’s detailed statistical and aggregation concerns do not appear in Review A. Thus alignment on weaknesses/limitations is only partial.",
      "overall": "In aggregate, the reviews describe a similar paper: a novel, spectral, training-free interpretability framework applied to multilingual voice alternation, finding model-family-specific fingerprints and linking them to behavior and attention heads. They agree on the main problem, method, and claimed contributions, and both recognize it as a meaningful, non-trivial interpretability effort. Where they diverge is in emphasis and judgment of the depth/rigor of the theory and empirics: Review B finds the theoretical underpinnings and many analyses solid, raising more surgical methodological concerns (aggregation, n reporting, correlation controls), while Review A is more skeptical about conceptual motivation, empirical strength, and practical impact, and is harsher on clarity. Both, however, flag that some empirical effects and causal interpretations need tightening and that presentation/figures could be improved. This yields a moderately strong overall alignment in substance and focus, but with noticeable differences in how positive or critical they are on key aspects like theoretical motivation and the robustness/utility of the results."

          "strength": "Both reviews agree on the central motivation: a training‑free, GSP-based framework over attention-induced token graphs using the Fiedler value/λ2 as a diagnostic, applied to voice alternation across 20 languages and 3 model families, with cross‑model ‘fingerprints’ and head ablations as key contributions. The AI review adds more detail (multiple spectral diagnostics, robustness checks, tokenizer‑stress analysis, hallucination detector) that the human review does not mention, but the core strengths of novelty, cross‑lingual coverage, and potential as a diagnostic interpretability tool are aligned.",
          "weakness": "Both identify conceptual/theoretical softness in connecting Δλ2/Fiedler to concrete syntactic computation and note that some empirical effects are small or inconsistent, cautioning against over‑strong conclusions; they also share concerns that causal/head‑ablation claims are under‑specified and need clearer methodology. The AI review emphasizes different additional weaknesses (reproducibility artifacts, tokenization/morphology confounds, multiplicity and outliers), while the human review uniquely stresses poor writing/figures and unclear practical utility (e.g., hallucination detection) and is more skeptical of the substantive size/consistency of the empirical findings.",
          "overall": "Substantively, both reviews see the paper as an interesting, technically nontrivial interpretability framework with meaningful cross‑family patterns, but limited by theoretical grounding and the strength/clarity of empirical and causal claims. The AI review is more positive on the rigor and impact and more granular about statistical and reproducibility issues, whereas the human review is more critical of motivation clarity, empirical robustness, and presentation; nonetheless, their high‑level picture of what the paper does well and where it is vulnerable is largely consistent."

The AI review adds many technical concerns absent from the human review (tokenization/morphology/length confounds, incomplete artifacts and dataset specification, multiplicity and outlier sensitivity), whereas the human review uniquely stresses weak motivation for Fiedler and the choice of voice alternation, as well as poor writing and figure readability.",
          "overall": "Taken together, both reviews converge on a picture of a novel and promising spectral framework whose core idea and cross-lingual design are strong, but whose theoretical grounding, empirical robustness, causal claims, and practical utility are not yet fully convincing. The AI review is more detailed and somewhat more positive about the formal spectral formulation and clarity, while still flagging many of the same high-level concerns, so the substantive focus and judgment are largely consistent but not near-identical."
