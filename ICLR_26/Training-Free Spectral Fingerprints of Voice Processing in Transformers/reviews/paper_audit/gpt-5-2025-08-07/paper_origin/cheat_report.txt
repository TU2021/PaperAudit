Integrity and Consistency Risk Report

Scope
This report flags high‑impact, evidence‑anchored inconsistencies, numerical mismatches, and missing methodological details that materially affect the paper’s correctness and trustworthiness. All references below point to specific manuscript blocks, figures, or tables.

Major internal inconsistencies and numerical mismatches

1) Contradictory claims about Qwen2.5‑7B early‑window Δλ₂ direction and magnitude
- Main results text states Qwen shows “small but consistent negative early shifts … with all types below zero” (Section 6.1; Block 17).
- The accompanying description for Figure 3 lists several positive early‑window means (non‑concatenative ≈ +0.02; particle ≈ +0.01; periphrastic ≈ 0.00) (Block 19), contradicting “all types below zero.”
- Appendix Table 6 reports the mean early‑window Δλ₂ across languages for Qwen as positive (+0.019 ± 0.006 under the default L_rw + mass‑weighted) (Block 72), contradicting the claim of uniformly negative shifts.
- Appendix expanded results later present Qwen early‑window Δλ₂ by category as uniformly negative (periphrastic −0.037; analytic −0.036; affixal −0.029; non‑concatenative −0.016) (Figure 10; Block 94), contradicting the earlier figure description with positive values and Table 6’s positive overall mean.
Impact: These contradictions undermine the reliability of the central cross‑family comparisons and the claimed “consistent negative” Qwen signature.

2) Spectral–behavioral correlation sign mismatch and variable definition ambiguity
- Text asserts “larger spectral disruptions (higher |Δλ₂|) correlate with worse performance (higher NLL)” (Section 6.3; Block 20).
- Table 3 reports Pearson correlations between Δλ₂ (not |Δλ₂|) and behavioral deltas as strongly negative for Phi‑3 (r = −0.976) and negative for Qwen (r = −0.627) (Block 26). A negative r between Δλ₂ and NLL implies that more negative Δλ₂ associates with higher NLL; this contradicts the stated relationship involving the magnitude |Δλ₂|.
- The text reiterates a “consistent negative correlation pattern” (Block 26) while earlier explicitly describing a magnitude correlation (Block 20).
Impact: Ambiguity about whether Δλ₂ or |Δλ₂| was used, and the sign explanation, materially affects interpretation of the claimed functional relevance.

3) Head aggregation “mass‑weighted” scheme is mathematically degenerate under the stated assumptions
- Attention matrices A^(ℓ,h) are defined as post‑softmax and row‑stochastic (Section 3.1; Block 8).
- Mass weights are defined as s_h^(ℓ) = ∑_{i,j} A_{ij}^{(ℓ,h)} and α_h^(ℓ) = s_h^(ℓ) / ∑_g s_g^(ℓ) (Block 8).
- For row‑stochastic A^(ℓ,h), ∑_{j} A_{ij}^{(ℓ,h)} = 1 for each row i; thus s_h^(ℓ) = N for all heads h, yielding α_h^(ℓ) = 1/H. This makes the “mass‑weighted” aggregation identical to uniform averaging, contrary to the implication that the weighting is informative. Appendix B.3 discusses agreement between uniform and mass‑weighted schemes (Block 53), but the default choice is presented as mass‑weighted (Block 8) without acknowledging that it collapses to uniform under the paper’s own assumptions.
Impact: This undermines claims about aggregation choices and robustness checks, and may affect computed spectral diagnostics and their interpretation.

4) Model identity/version inconsistencies across analyses
- Core models are Qwen2.5‑7B, Phi‑3‑Mini, LLaMA‑3.2‑1B (Section 4; Block 13).
- Behavioral validation explicitly uses Qwen‑2.2‑7b (Appendix E.3; Block 95), not Qwen2.5‑7B. No justification is provided for mixing model versions across spectral and behavioral analyses.
- Reasoning strategy generalization uses “phi‑3.5‑mini” (Section 7.1; Block 32), whereas main experiments use “Phi‑3‑Mini.”
Impact: Mixing different model versions without clear rationale confounds cross‑section interpretations (spectral vs. behavioral and reasoning), weakening claims of correlational alignment and generalization.

5) Fractional “layer” indices without definition
- Several figures/tables report non‑integer layer indices (e.g., “2.5”) (Appendix; Block 81). The manuscript does not define fractional layers or how these are computed.
Impact: Unclear layer indexing compromises the interpretability and reproducibility of layer‑resolved spectral trajectories and early‑window endpoints.

6) Unsupported numeric exemplars and missing anchors
- Section 5 cites specific values (e.g., “Yoruba: 0.57 pieces/char, |Δλ₂| = 0.054”; “English: 0.20 pieces/char”) to illustrate tokenizer stress (Block 14).
- No table/figure provides these exact values for the referenced model (Qwen for Yoruba; Phi for English pieces/char). The Phi‑3 per‑language list (Figure 2a; Block 19) shows Yoruba |Δλ₂| ≈ 0.006, not 0.054, and pertains to Phi, not Qwen.
Impact: Unanchored numerical examples weaken the credibility of the tokenizer‑stress analysis. Evidence link: No direct evidence found in the manuscript for Yoruba |Δλ₂| = 0.054 and English 0.20 pieces/char.

7) Ambiguity and missing details in ablation methodology
- Ablations are described as “L2 & L3 H0–7,” “L2 H0–3,” “L3 & L4 H0–3” (Section 6.4; Block 27), but key implementation details are not specified: how heads are ablated (zeroed weights? attention masking? value/key removal?), whether ablations are applied during inference only, and how Δλ₂ is recomputed post‑ablation across languages.
- Table 4 labels “Δλ₂ Early [2–5], Mid [6–10], Late, Overall” with “positive values indicate increased spectral separation” (Block 30), but earlier Δλ₂ was defined as passive − active (Section 3.2; Block 10). The phrase “Fiedler gap Δλ₂” is not formally defined, nor is “Overall” aggregation described.
Impact: Insufficient methodological detail prevents independent verification of causal claims and the interpretation of positive/negative shifts.

Additional issues affecting clarity or reproducibility

8) FDR significance claims without visible statistics
- The paper states “several periphrastic/affixal effects are FDR–sig and negative” for Qwen (Figure 3; Block 19), but no per‑language/type p‑values or q‑values are shown in the figures or tables in the main body. Appendix contains general procedures (Blocks 55, 89) but not the actual significance outputs for these claims.
Impact: Significance assertions lack direct documentary support. Evidence link: No direct per‑language/type FDR statistics found in the manuscript figures/tables corresponding to the claim.

9) Inconsistent summaries of Qwen results across sections
- Main text (Block 17) claims uniformly negative Qwen early shifts; Figure description in the same block shows positive categories. Appendix expanded results (Block 94) show uniformly negative category means; Appendix Table 6 (Block 72) shows a positive overall mean. These cannot all be simultaneously true.
Impact: The internal variability in Qwen summaries suggests aggregation or preprocessing differences that are not documented, risking misinterpretation of cross‑family signatures.

10) Evidence gap for theoretical predictions beyond voice alternation
- The Method predicts voice alternation effects should exceed tense/number contrasts (Section 3.2; Block 10). Appendix states “Sanity controls for tense/number … do not reproduce the voice signatures” (Block 79), but no data or figures are provided for these sanity checks.
Impact: No direct evidence found in the manuscript to support the stated comparative prediction.

Constructive recommendations

- Resolve Qwen inconsistencies by explicitly reporting the exact datasets, preprocessing, aggregation schemes, and endpoints used for each figure/table. Reconcile Table 6 (+0.019 mean) with Figure 3/category claims and Appendix expanded results, or clarify that different cohorts/normalizations were used.
- Clarify the variable used in spectral–behavioral correlations (Δλ₂ vs |Δλ₂|). If magnitude was intended, provide the correlation coefficients with |Δλ₂| alongside Δλ₂, and explain the sign interpretation coherently.
- Correct or justify the head aggregation weighting: explicitly state why s_h differs across heads despite row‑stochastic attention, or redefine mass weighting (e.g., using pre‑softmax mass or learned α_h) to avoid the degeneracy.
- Standardize model versions across spectral and behavioral analyses or provide a clear rationale for differences, including sensitivity analyses showing that conclusions are robust across versions.
- Define fractional layer indices and the computation of “Overall” ablation effects; specify ablation implementation details sufficient for replication.
- Provide tables/figures for tokenizer metrics (pieces/char, fragmentation entropy) per language/model to substantiate exemplar values (e.g., Yoruba 0.57 pieces/char, |Δλ₂| = 0.054).
- Include actual p/q‑values for FDR‑adjusted tests in the figures or in accompanying tables, especially where “FDR‑sig” claims are made.

Conclusion
The manuscript presents a promising spectral analysis framework, but multiple internally conflicting statements and missing methodological details materially affect the validity of its cross‑family conclusions, especially for Qwen2.5‑7B, and the interpretation of spectral–behavioral correlations. Addressing the documented inconsistencies and providing the missing evidence would substantially strengthen the paper’s scientific integrity.
