      "strength": "The two reviews are clearly about completely different papers. Review A discusses SafeAgents and DHARMA for security evaluation of multi-agent LLM systems, focusing on MAS architectures, adversarial prompting, and a failure taxonomy. Review B analyzes a method called G-Star for masked diffusion language models, focusing on star-shaped diffusion, remasking, an error predictor, and empirical results on OpenWebText, Conala, and Dream-Instruct. There is no overlap in the described problem, method, contributions, or strengths.",
      "weakness": "The weaknesses identified are also entirely unrelated. Review A raises concerns about LLM-as-judge reliability, taxonomy consistency in DHARMA, lack of mechanistic analysis of MAS design primitives, limited novelty, writing clarity, and missing comparisons across threat models in MAS security. Review B instead points out a likely table error in experimental results, missing formal proof of equivalence to ReMDM, lack of runtime metrics and statistical significance, limited baselines for guidance methods, and diversity–quality trade-offs in text generation. There is no shared or overlapping concern.",
      "overall": "Because the two reviews are about different topics, methods, experiments, and contribution types, they do not align in substance, focus, or judgment. The papers they describe are completely distinct, so alignment between the reviews on any content dimension is effectively zero."
