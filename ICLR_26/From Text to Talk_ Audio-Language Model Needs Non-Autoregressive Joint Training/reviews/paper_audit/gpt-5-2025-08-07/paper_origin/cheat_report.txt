Academic Integrity and Consistency Risk Report

Scope and standard: This review flags substantive, evidence-backed inconsistencies or omissions that affect the paper’s correctness, trustworthiness, or reproducibility. Each point is anchored to specific locations in the manuscript. No speculation on intent is made.

1) Evaluation dataset inconsistencies (naming and splits)
- Evidence:
  - Table 1 (Block #36) evaluates Audio‑QA on AE (AlpacaEval), LQ (LLaMAQuestions), TQA (TriviaQA), WQ (WebQuestions), and ASR on Fleurs‑zh, AISHELL‑2, AISHELL‑1, WenetSpeech‑test_meeting (WS_met.), WenetSpeech‑test_net (WS_net), Fleurs‑en.
  - Section 4.2 (Blocks #38–39) discusses performance on AlpacaEval, LLaMAQuestions, TriviaQA, WebQuestions.
  - Appendix A.5.2 Table 4 (Block #64) lists Audio‑QA datasets as AlpacaEval, TriviaQA, WebQuestions, and ReasoningQA (Chinese) — LLaMAQuestions is not listed. For ASR, it lists “WenetSpeech” without specifying the “test_meeting”/“test_net” splits reported in Table 1.
- Why this matters: The mismatch between the main results (Table 1) and the stated evaluation datasets (Appendix) obscures exactly which benchmarks were used and which splits were evaluated, hindering verification and replication.
- Required clarification: Precisely list the Audio‑QA datasets used in Table 1 (including whether LLaMAQuestions or ReasoningQA was used) and specify the exact WenetSpeech splits for the ASR results.

2) Contradictory description of audio tokenizer/decoder
- Evidence:
  - Section 3.5 (Block #26): “we adopt CosyVoice (Du et al., 2024) as both the audio encoder and decoder.”
  - Section 4.1.5 (Block #35): “we directly follow the audio tokenizer and decoder design introduced in GLM‑4‑Voice (Zeng et al., 2024).”
- Why this matters: The encoder/decoder choice materially affects implementation and comparability. The paper does not establish that GLM‑4‑Voice’s design and CosyVoice are identical; within‑paper evidence connecting the two is missing.
- Required clarification: Specify whether the implementation uses CosyVoice modules, GLM‑4‑Voice modules, or a combination; detail versions and any modifications.

3) Scaling claim contradicted by reported baseline results
- Evidence:
  - Section 4.2 (Blocks #38–39): “we observe a clear scaling trend shared with the baselines, where larger backbones consistently yield stronger performance.”
  - Table 1 (Block #36): For the AR baseline, the 3B model underperforms the 1.5B model on all four Audio‑QA metrics (e.g., AE: 14.42 < 17.99; LQ: 10.00 < 16.78; TQA: 0.60 < 1.61; WQ: 0.70 < 2.32).
- Why this matters: The stated conclusion (“shared with the baselines”) is not supported by the AR baseline numbers and overstates the generality of the scaling behavior.
- Required correction: Revise the scaling claim to match the data, and discuss why the AR baseline degrades with scale on these metrics.

4) Ambiguity in the NAR generation algorithm vs. text description
- Evidence:
  - Algorithm title (Block #60): “Block‑wise Masked Diffusion for Autoregressive Audio Generation” — labeled “Autoregressive,” though the paper consistently treats audio as non‑autoregressive diffusion (Abstract Block #2; Section 3.2 Block #16; Figure 3(b) Block #24).
  - Section 3.5 (Blocks #26–28): Inference alternates between AR text and NAR audio; after predicting ⟨EOA⟩, control returns to AR.
  - Algorithm 1 (Block #60) lines 30–32: On encountering ⟨EOA⟩ within a block, the procedure returns s immediately. The function preamble (“Ensure: Generated token sequence s…”) does not clearly state whether this routine is scoped to a single audio span or the whole sequence, making the early return ambiguous relative to the “return to AR” behavior described in Section 3.5.
- Why this matters: Mislabeling and unclear procedure boundaries make it hard to reproduce the alternating AR↔NAR decoding.
- Required clarification: Fix the algorithm title (NAR vs. AR), explicitly scope Algorithm 1 to “audio span generation,” and describe how control returns to AR decoding in the overall loop.

5) Mathematical/notation inconsistencies and undefined terms
- Evidence:
  - Eq. 9 (Block #16): Conditions include “A_m^{∪ M}” (or visually “A_m^{\cup M}”), which is never defined. The notation “A_m^λ” appears in text but the precise construction/distribution over masked sets is not formalized.
  - Eqs. 14, 15, 19 (Blocks #18–19): Use |T_m|, despite earlier defining text spans as 𝒯_m with cardinality |𝒯_m| (Blocks #7, #14–15). The switch between T_m and 𝒯_m is not explained.
- Why this matters: Ambiguous conditioning terms and inconsistent notation in core objectives impede correct reimplementation and theoretical verification.
- Required correction: Define A_m^{∪ M} (or remove if a typo), formalize the distribution over masked sets in Eq. 9, and unify notation for text spans throughout.

6) Training data accounting is incomplete/ambiguous
- Evidence:
  - Section 4.1.1 (Block #31): “we randomly sample one million instances from the ASR dataset, the TTS dataset, and the audio chat dataset respectively.”
  - Table 2 (Block #63): Many rows have blank “Samples” counts (e.g., AISHELL‑1/2/3, CommonVoice, LibriSpeech, MLS‑Eng, PeopleSpeech, VoxPopuli, VoiceAssistant‑400K, Firefly‑Train‑1.1M, etc.). The reported “Total = 6,321,321” equals the sum of only those rows with non‑blank counts (e.g., Emilia_zh 500k + Emilia_en 500k + GigaSpeech 600k + WenetSpeech 400k + OpenHermes‑2.5 1M + MathInstruct 262,039 + Nonspeech7k 59,282 + Chinese‑FineWeb‑Edu 1.5M + FineWeb‑Edu 1.5M). Datasets with blank counts appear not to contribute to the total, despite being listed as used.
- Why this matters: Without explicit counts for all listed datasets and a reconciliation to the stated sampling strategy, the actual composition of the 6.3M examples is unclear, undermining reproducibility and fairness assessments.
- Required clarification: Provide sample counts for all listed datasets (or explicitly state which were excluded), and reconcile with the “randomly sample one million per category” statement.

7) Evaluation dataset coverage mismatch
- Evidence:
  - Appendix A.5.2 (Block #64) claims Audio‑QA covers both English and Chinese (lists ReasoningQA as Chinese), but the main results table (Block #36) does not report any Chinese Audio‑QA column.
- Why this matters: The described evaluation scope (cross‑lingual Audio‑QA) is not reflected in the reported results, leaving the Chinese Audio‑QA evaluation unsupported by data in the main text.
- Required clarification: Either report the Chinese Audio‑QA results or adjust the stated evaluation scope.

8) Missing reference details for the judge model
- Evidence:
  - Section 4.1.2 (Block #32) uses “Qwen3‑235B‑A30B” as LLM‑as‑a‑Judge.
  - References (Blocks #45–49) do not include an entry for “Qwen3‑235B‑A30B.” No configuration or version details are provided beyond the name. No direct evidence found in the manuscript regarding its citation.
- Why this matters: The judging model materially affects Audio‑QA scoring; lack of citation/details reduces transparency and repeatability.
- Required clarification: Add a reference and basic configuration details (version, prompt, temperature, grading rubric).

If addressed, the manuscript would be notably more reproducible and internally consistent.

No other clear integrity‑related issues were identified beyond the above inconsistencies and missing details based on the provided manuscript.
