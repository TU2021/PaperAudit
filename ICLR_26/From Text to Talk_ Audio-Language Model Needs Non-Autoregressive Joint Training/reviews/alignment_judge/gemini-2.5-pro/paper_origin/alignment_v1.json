          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the innovative AR-NAR hybrid approach, the strong theoretical grounding, and the effective training strategies validated by ablations. The alignment is very high, with only minor differences in granularity, such as the AI review explicitly highlighting the attention mask design.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews agree on the major weakness of lacking proper audio quality metrics (like MOS). However, they diverge significantly otherwise; the AI review introduces several critical points absent in the human review, including unfair baselines, potential data leakage, and a specific theoretical imprecision, while the human review focuses more on the limited scope of tasks and SOTA comparisons.",
          "overall": "The reviews strongly agree on the paper's core contributions and strengths, but only moderately agree on its weaknesses. The AI review is more critical of the internal experimental rigor and theoretical precision, whereas the human review is more concerned with external validation and scope. This results in a high but not perfect alignment, as their judgments on what constitutes the most important flaws differ."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the innovative AR-NAR hybrid approach, the theoretical justification, the specific training strategies, and strong empirical results as the main strengths. Review B is more detailed, but the core positive points are highly consistent with Review A.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews agree on the lack of human audio quality evaluation (MOS) and the limited scope of tasks. However, Review B identifies several additional major weaknesses missed by Review A, including the lack of latency benchmarks, unfair baseline comparisons, and reproducibility concerns.",
          "overall": "The reviews align well on the paper's core contribution and its primary strengths, but diverge significantly in their critical assessment. While they share two key weaknesses, Review B presents a much broader and deeper critique of the experimental validation, resulting in a moderate overall alignment in judgment and focus."

While both conclude the evaluation is incomplete, they prioritize different flaws, leading to a consistent overall judgment (a strong but flawed paper) that is supported by partially different evidence."
