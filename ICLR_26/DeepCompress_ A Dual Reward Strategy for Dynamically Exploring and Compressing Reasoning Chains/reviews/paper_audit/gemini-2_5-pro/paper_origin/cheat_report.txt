Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several clear internal inconsistencies and numerical mismatches have been identified that materially affect the paper's claims and trustworthiness.

### **Integrity and Consistency Report**

**1. Major Inconsistency Between Claimed Efficiency Gains and Presented Data**

The manuscript claims a specific, significant efficiency improvement that is directly contradicted by the numerical data provided in the same section.

*   **Claim:** In Section 5.2, the authors state: "On average, DeepCompress compresses the response length by 57.9% with the 3B model and **16.6% with the 7B model**." (Block #29).
*   **Evidence:** The data presented in the text list below Table 1 and visualized in Figure 3 (Block #29, #31) for the 7B models are as follows:
    *   MATH500: 4,829 → 2,234 (53.7% reduction)
    *   AMC23: 4,267 → 2,124 (50.2% reduction)
    *   OlympiadBench: 4,781 → 2,640 (44.8% reduction)
    *   MinervaMath: 4,481 → 2,744 (38.8% reduction)
    *   AIME24: 11,091 → 7,181 (35.2% reduction)
    *   AIME25: 6,397 → 5,816 (9.1% reduction)
    *   PolyMath: 5,334 → 4,476 (16.1% reduction)
*   **Inconsistency:** Calculating the average of these percentage reductions yields **35.4%**. An alternative calculation based on the total number of tokens across all datasets ((41180 - 27215) / 41180) yields a **33.9%** reduction. Both values are more than double the claimed **16.6%**. This is a significant numerical error that misrepresents the efficiency gains of the 7B model. While the model does show efficiency improvements, the claimed magnitude is factually incorrect based on the paper's own data.

**2. Numerical Mismatch Between Method Description and Visualization**

There is a clear numerical conflict between the description of the reward function's implementation and its graphical representation.

*   **Claim:** Appendix B, Table 3 specifies the hyperparameter for the length reward magnitude as `reward_weight α = 0.2` (Block #44). The total reward is defined as `R = R_o + R_l`, where `R_l = α × R_z(ŷ, β)` (Equation 9, Block #20). The outcome reward `R_o` is either +1 or -1 (Equation 2, Block #12).
*   **Evidence:** Figure 2 (Block #17, #18) visualizes this total reward `R`. Based on the formula, the reward `R` for correct responses (`R_o=1`) should range between `1.0` and `1.0 + α = 1.2`. The reward for incorrect responses (`R_o=-1`) should range between `-1.0` and `-1.0 + α = -0.8`.
*   **Inconsistency:** The y-axes in Figure 2a and 2b clearly show the reward for correct responses ranging from approximately 1.0 to 1.1, and for incorrect responses from -1.0 to -0.9. This visual evidence implies that `α` is approximately 0.1, which directly contradicts the value of `α=0.2` stated in the appendix. This discrepancy raises questions about the actual implementation of the core reward mechanism.

**3. Inaccurate Figure Caption**

The caption for a key figure incorrectly describes its content, potentially misleading the reader.

*   **Claim:** The caption for Figure 2 states: "For both, **Blue indicates correct responses and Red indicates incorrect responses**." (Block #15).
*   **Evidence:** The figure itself (Block #17, #18) contains a legend where different shades of blue and red correspond to different values of the hyperparameter `β` (e.g., `β = 0.2`, `β = 0.4`, etc.). The distinction between correct and incorrect responses is shown by two separate clusters of curves—one originating from the `R_o (Correct)` baseline at y=1.0 and the other from the `R_o (Incorrect)` baseline at y=-1.0.
*   **Inconsistency:** The color in the figure encodes the value of `β`, not the correctness of the response. The caption is factually incorrect and misrepresents how the information is visualized.

**4. Potentially Contradictory Ablation Results**

The results of the ablation study appear to challenge the main claim of superior accuracy.

*   **Claim:** The paper's central thesis is that DeepCompress achieves "superior accuracy" and "simultaneously enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs" (Block #2, #4).
*   **Evidence:** In the ablation study presented in Section 5.3, Figure 4c (Block #39) shows the test performance (pass@1 score) over training steps. The "w/ Length Bonus" variant (teal line) consistently achieves a higher pass@1 score than the proposed DeepCompress method (red line) in the later stages of training. The authors acknowledge this, stating "the length bonus variant exhibits higher performance compared to other methods" (Block #34).
*   **Inconsistency:** While the authors argue that DeepCompress provides a better balance by also being more efficient (Figure 4d), the fact that another variant achieves strictly better accuracy contradicts the unqualified claim of "superior accuracy." This finding suggests that always encouraging longer responses may be a better strategy for accuracy alone, which complicates the paper's narrative about the optimality of its adaptive approach.

### **Conclusion**

The manuscript contains significant, evidence-based internal inconsistencies, most notably a major numerical error in reporting a key efficiency result. These issues undermine the reliability of the reported findings and require substantial correction and clarification before the work can be considered scientifically valid.
