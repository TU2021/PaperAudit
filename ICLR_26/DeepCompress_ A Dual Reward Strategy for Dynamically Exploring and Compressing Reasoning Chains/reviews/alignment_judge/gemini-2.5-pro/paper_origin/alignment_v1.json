        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contribution (a dynamic, dual-reward for length control) and its primary strength (improving accuracy while reducing tokens). The human review also notes post-rebuttal strengths (e.g., generalization), which the AI correctly flags as a pre-rebuttal weakness, but the core points align very well.",
          "weakness": "There is moderate overlap, with both reviews identifying the method's sensitivity to length variance and the need for more ablations. However, the human review uniquely points out a critical conceptual flaw (the 'no-correct-rollout' paradox), while the AI review uniquely focuses on missing experimental details like compute reporting and specific component ablations.",
          "overall": "The reviews align on the overall positive judgment of the paper as a novel and empirically effective contribution. However, their focus diverges in the critiques, with the human review emphasizing conceptual limitations of the RL design and the AI review emphasizing gaps in experimental rigor and reporting, resulting in only partial substantive alignment."

        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core contribution as an adaptive dual-reward for length control and highlight the strong empirical results on math benchmarks as a key strength. Review A, having seen a rebuttal, also includes generalization beyond math as a strength, whereas Review B correctly identifies its absence in the original paper as a weakness.",
          "weakness": "There is strong alignment on two critical weaknesses: the 'no-correct-rollout' paradox (sparse reward signal for hard problems) and the mismatch between pass@k training dynamics and pass@1 evaluation. However, Review B introduces several major points absent in Review A, such as the lack of hyperparameter sensitivity analysis and statistical significance testing.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's central idea, its primary strengths, and a few crucial, non-obvious weaknesses. Their overall judgment is consistent, but they diverge in focus, with Review A emphasizing conceptual critiques and Review B focusing more on empirical completeness, a difference compounded by Review A's access to rebuttal information."

They also agree on the key strengths, including the intuitive concept, strong empirical results, and efforts to ensure training stability.",
          "weakness": "There is overlap on a few major conceptual weaknesses, such as the sparse reward problem for hard questions and the train/eval objective mismatch. However, Review B identifies numerous concrete internal inconsistencies and numerical errors that are entirely absent from Review A, and it also contradicts Review A on the scope of the evaluation.",
          "overall": "The reviews align very well on the paper's strengths but diverge significantly on its weaknesses, with Review B focusing heavily on factual inconsistencies and reporting sloppiness missed by Review A. This leads to only a moderate overall alignment, as the substance and focus of the critiques are quite different despite agreement on the paper's core idea."
