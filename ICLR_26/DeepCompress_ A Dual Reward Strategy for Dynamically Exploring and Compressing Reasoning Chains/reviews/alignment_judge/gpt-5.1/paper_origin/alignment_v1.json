    "explanation": {
      "strength": "Both reviews clearly agree on the core motivation and contributions. They describe DeepCompress as an RL-based, dual-regime length-control method for large reasoning models, using model-aware, online difficulty (via group/batch pass ratios) to encourage shorter chains on easy problems and longer chains on hard ones. Both emphasize that this addresses the overthinking/underthinking trade-off, that the mechanism is implemented via a bounded length reward added to outcome reward, and that it is conceptually simple and practically useful. They also converge on the main empirical strengths: strong gains on math benchmarks, improved pass@1 together with substantial token savings, and helpful diagnostic analyses (training dynamics, policy entropy, reflection behavior). Review A also notes added non-math benchmarks and stability evidence; Review B emphasizes equations, figures, and detailed mechanism, but these are complementary details around the same core strengths, hence high alignment.",
      "weakness": "There is partial but not full overlap in the weaknesses raised. Points of alignment: both note concerns around dependence on within-group length variance and standardization (σ issues) and the absence of sensitivity analyses/ablations for key hyperparameters and design components; both mention some gaps or inconsistencies in methodological clarity (e.g., RL algorithm naming, missing experimental details/compute fairness); and both express that the method is essentially reward shaping without deep theoretical analysis of its interaction with the base RL objective. However, Review A raises several specific concerns that are largely absent from Review B: (1) the relativistic, batch-dependent definition of difficulty and its conceptual implications; (2) the \"no-correct-rollout\" paradox where hard questions with zero correct samples may receive no exploratory signal; (3) tension between pass@k-like training dynamics and pass@1 evaluation; (4) dependence on decoding diversity/temperature. Conversely, Review B repeatedly stresses missing compute reporting, fairness of training budgets, lack of ablations for correctness-conditioning and EMA, limited evaluation beyond math (before rebuttal), verifier noise, and lack of comparison to certain baselines; these are not central in Review A, which instead notes that additional non-math benchmarks and stronger baselines were added in rebuttal. Because they share some technical concerns but differ on several key criticisms, the alignment on weaknesses is moderate rather than high.",
      "overall": "Substantively, both reviews see the paper as a sound, well-motivated RL reward-shaping approach that adaptively controls reasoning length using online difficulty, with strong empirical evidence on math reasoning and meaningful efficiency gains. They agree on the main conceptual novelty and basic mechanism, and they both view the work positively while asking for more analysis/ablations. The main divergence is in the emphasis and nature of weaknesses: the human review focuses more on conceptual and methodological edge cases specific to difficulty definition, exploration signals, and evaluation mismatch, while the AI review emphasizes experimental completeness, sensitivity studies, compute fairness, and breadth of evaluation. Thus, the overall alignment is reasonably strong on core ideas and judgment, but not complete, leading to a mid-to-high overall alignment score."

        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews clearly agree on the core motivation: adaptively controlling reasoning length based on problem difficulty to improve pass@1 while saving tokens, using a dual/conditional length reward on top of Zero-RL/DAPO-style training. They also overlap on main strengths such as the formalized dual reward mechanism, correctness-conditioned shaping, training stability measures (e.g., EMA over batch pass ratio), and strong empirical gains on math benchmarks with notable compression and expanded analyses of training dynamics. The human review adds emphasis on generalization to non-math benchmarks and stability curves, while the AI review adds more detail on equations and reproducibility aids, but these are extensions rather than contradictions.",
          "weakness": "There is partial overlap in weaknesses: both note a tension between the training objective (group-based, pass@k-style exploration) and the evaluation focus on pass@1, and both flag concerns about the correctness-conditioned length reward potentially yielding sparse shaping early in training. However, the human review emphasizes issues like batch-relative/dynamic difficulty definition, dependence on length variance/decoding diversity, and the 'no-correct-rollout' paradox—points the AI review does not explicitly discuss. Conversely, the AI review raises several concerns (limited statistical reporting, lack of hyperparameter sensitivity analyses, verifier documentation, narrow math-only scope in the original submission) that are not central in the human review, especially as the human review accounts for additional rebuttal experiments beyond math.",
          "overall": "Taken together, the reviews are strongly aligned on the main story: an interesting, well-formalized adaptive length-control method that improves accuracy and efficiency, but with remaining questions about objective alignment and some methodological gaps. Differences lie mostly in which secondary weaknesses are highlighted—conceptual dynamics and edge cases in the human review versus reporting/sensitivity and generality issues in the AI review. The substantive judgment and high-level focus are largely consistent, with some divergence in detailed critiques, leading to high but not perfect overall alignment."
