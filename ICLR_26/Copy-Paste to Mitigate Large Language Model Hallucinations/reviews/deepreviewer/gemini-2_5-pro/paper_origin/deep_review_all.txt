### **Review 1**

**Summary**
This paper addresses the problem of contextual hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where Large Language Models (LLMs) often favor their internal parametric knowledge over the provided context. The authors propose that encouraging a high degree of "copy-paste" behavior from the context can serve as an effective proxy for contextual faithfulness. They introduce CopyPasteLLM, a model trained via a two-stage pipeline. The first stage uses three novel prompting methods (CP-Order, CP-Link, CP-Refine) to generate high-copying responses. The second stage uses these responses to create preference data for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), training the model to prefer context-faithful, high-copying outputs. To analyze the model's behavior, the authors also propose the "Context-Parameter Copying Capturing" algorithm. Experiments show that CopyPasteLLM significantly improves contextual faithfulness on benchmarks like FaithEval, even with a remarkably small training dataset.

**Soundness**
The methodological soundness of the paper is strong. The core hypothesis—that an increased copying degree correlates with reduced hallucination—is grounded in an initial empirical observation on the RAGTruth dataset (Figure 1). The two-stage training pipeline is logical: first, generate the desired behavior (high-copying) using various prompting strategies, and second, internalize this behavior using a well-established alignment technique like DPO. The automated pipeline for creating preference data (Figure 2), including multi-criteria filtering and an LLM-as-Judge tournament, is a well-designed and scalable approach. The interpretability analysis, using the proposed Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm, provides compelling evidence for the mechanistic claims. The finding that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates reliance on parametric knowledge rather than altering contextual representations (Figure 4) is a key insight and is well-supported by the hidden state visualizations.

**Presentation**
The paper is exceptionally well-written and clearly organized. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and situates the work within the existing literature. The methodology is presented with clarity, aided by excellent diagrams (Figure 2, 13, 14) that break down the complex two-stage pipeline into understandable components. The experimental section is structured around clear research questions (RQ1-RQ3), which guides the reader through the results. The figures, particularly the logits power distributions (Figure 3) and the UMAP visualizations of hidden states (Figure 4), are effective at communicating the core findings of the interpretability analysis. The appendices are comprehensive, providing all necessary prompts, algorithm details, and hyperparameters for reproducibility. The only minor issue is the textual reference to Tables 1 and 2, which appear to be missing from the main body, though their results are well-described in the text (Section 4.1.1, 4.1.2).

**Contribution**
The paper makes several significant contributions to the field of trustworthy AI and RAG systems:
1.  It introduces a simple yet powerful idea: using "copy-paste" as an operational proxy for contextual faithfulness, which also inherently provides attribution.
2.  It proposes a novel and highly data-efficient two-stage training framework (CopyPasteLLM) that demonstrably and substantially improves faithfulness, especially in challenging counterfactual scenarios.
3.  It develops a new interpretability tool, Context-Parameter Copying Capturing, which extends prior work to analyze the full generation trajectory and provides novel insights into how models balance knowledge sources.
4.  The empirical results, particularly the 12.2%-24.5% accuracy improvement on FaithEval with only 365 training samples, represent a major advancement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

**Strengths**
- **Novel and Intuitive Core Idea:** The central concept of using copy-paste behavior to enforce faithfulness is both novel and highly intuitive. It elegantly sidesteps the complexities of semantic matching and provides a direct, verifiable link to the source context.
- **Exceptional Data Efficiency:** The ability to achieve state-of-the-art results with only 365 training samples (a 50x reduction compared to baselines like Context-DPO) is a standout strength, making the method highly practical and scalable.
- **Strong Empirical Results:** The performance gains on FaithEval are massive and convincing (Table 1 description, Appendix Table 5). The method's effectiveness across both counterfactual and standard QA settings (Table 3) demonstrates its robustness.
- **Insightful Mechanistic Analysis:** The paper goes beyond just showing *that* the method works and provides a compelling explanation for *why* it works. The analysis using the Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm, which reveals the recalibration of parametric knowledge confidence (Figure 4), is a significant contribution in itself.
- **High Reproducibility:** The authors provide extensive details in the appendix, including all prompts, algorithms, and hyperparameters, and have released the code, adhering to the best practices of open science.

**Weaknesses**
- **Missing Tables:** The main text describes the results of Table 1 and Table 2, but the tables themselves are not present. While the description is clear, their inclusion would strengthen the presentation. This seems to be a formatting error.
- **Fluency Trade-off:** While the paper mentions fluency as a metric, the trade-off between high copying and response fluency could be explored more deeply. The hard-constraint methods (CP-Order, CP-Link) are noted to have poorer fluency (Section 4.1.1), and a more quantitative analysis of this trade-off in the final CopyPasteLLM would be beneficial.

**Questions**
1.  The data generation pipeline seems to involve multiple LLM calls per sample (generation, filtering, judging). Could you comment on the computational cost of generating the preference dataset for the 365 samples compared to the training cost of baselines that use larger datasets?
2.  The "stamping" process in Algorithm 2, where gold/wrong answers are appended to create preference pairs, is a clever trick. Did you experiment with DPO training without this step, and if so, how much does this specific strategy contribute to the final performance?
3.  How does CopyPasteLLM perform when the provided context is noisy, contains contradictory information, or is incomplete? The ethics statement acknowledges the risk of copying incorrect source material, but an empirical evaluation of this scenario would be very insightful.

**Rating**
- Overall (10): 9 — The paper presents a novel, highly effective, and data-efficient method with strong empirical backing and insightful analysis.
- Novelty (10): 9 — The core idea of using copy-paste as a proxy for faithfulness and the associated training pipeline is highly novel.
- Technical Quality (10): 9 — The methodology is sound, the experiments are rigorous, and the interpretability analysis is a key technical strength.
- Clarity (10): 9 — The paper is exceptionally clear and well-organized, despite a minor issue with missing tables in the main text.
- Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment; the paper's claims are well-supported by the provided evidence.

### **Review 2**

**Summary**
This paper proposes "CopyPasteLLM," a method to improve the contextual faithfulness of retrieval-augmented LLMs by training them to prefer responses that heavily copy from the provided context. The authors' motivating observation is an inverse correlation between the degree of copying and hallucination rates. Their method involves a two-stage process: first, generating a set of candidate responses using three "CopyPaste-Prompting" techniques with varying levels of extractive constraints; second, using an automated pipeline with an LLM-as-judge to create preference pairs from these candidates to fine-tune a base model with DPO. The authors also introduce an analysis tool, "Context-Parameter Copying Capturing," to probe the model's reliance on contextual versus parametric knowledge. The results show significant improvements in faithfulness on several benchmarks, most notably FaithEval, using a very small training set.

**Soundness**
The paper's premise rests on the assumption that a high degree of lexical overlap with the context is a reliable proxy for faithfulness. While the initial correlation shown in Figure 1 is suggestive, this assumption is a significant simplification. A model could copy irrelevant or out-of-context sentences, or stitch copied fragments together incoherently, leading to responses that are lexically faithful but semantically incorrect or unhelpful. The paper attempts to mitigate this with query relevance and fluency filtering, but the fundamental soundness of the proxy is debatable.

The methodology for generating preference data (Algorithm 2) is overly complex. It involves generating six different responses, multi-criteria filtering with several metrics (AlignScore, MiniCheck, κ, δ, similarity, perplexity), and an Elo-style tournament. This intricate pipeline raises questions about its robustness and the sensitivity to the many thresholds and components involved. For instance, how were the filtering thresholds `θ_j` chosen? The performance of the LLM-as-judge is also critical and can be unreliable, yet it forms the backbone of the preference ranking.

The "Context-Parameter Copying Capturing" algorithm (Algorithm 3) has several heuristic steps that lack rigorous justification. The definition of "meaningless" tokens (line 8) is not provided, which is a crucial detail. The filtering of common substrings `S_com` (line 10) seems ad-hoc. The logits power formula (Eq. 2 in Appendix) is non-standard and its motivation is not explained; why use the sum of squared logits multiplied by the square root of sample count, instead of a more standard measure like token probability? These choices reduce the confidence in the conclusions drawn from the analysis.

**Presentation**
The paper is generally well-written, but the presentation suffers from some key omissions and a lack of clarity in certain figures. Tables 1 and 2 are referenced but missing from the main body, which is a significant flaw that forces the reader to trust the textual summary of the results. In Figure 1, the relationship between the kernel density plots (copying) and the bar charts (hallucination) is not immediately intuitive. Figure 3 uses a custom "Logits Power" metric without justification, making it difficult to interpret its absolute meaning. The appendices are extensive, which is good for reproducibility, but key details like the definition of "meaningless tokens" in Algorithm 3 are still missing. The overall structure is logical, but the density of the methodology requires careful reading to fully grasp.

**Contribution**
The paper's main contribution is the idea of using explicit copying as a training signal for faithfulness. While related to extractive methods, framing it as a preference for DPO is novel. The data-efficiency of the method is also a notable claim. However, the contribution is somewhat weakened by the complexity of the pipeline and the strong, potentially brittle, assumptions it relies on. The proposed analysis algorithm, "Context-Parameter Copying Capturing," is an incremental extension of prior work (KTC) and its own soundness is questionable due to several heuristic design choices. The impressive results on FaithEval are the paper's strongest point, but it is unclear if this performance will generalize beyond benchmarks that test for reliance on counter-intuitive context, where simply "ignoring" parametric knowledge is the optimal strategy.

**Strengths**
- **Impressive Empirical Results on Counterfactuals:** The reported accuracy improvements on the FaithEval benchmark are substantial and represent a clear strength of the proposed method (Section 4.1.2, Appendix Table 5).
- **Data Efficiency:** Achieving these results with only 365 training samples is a significant practical advantage, assuming the data generation process is not prohibitively expensive.
- **Automated Data Pipeline:** The pipeline for generating preference data is fully automated, removing the need for human annotation, which is a valuable feature.

**Weaknesses**
- **Oversimplified Proxy for Faithfulness:** The core assumption that "copying is faithfulness" is a heuristic that may not hold in more complex scenarios. It risks promoting extractive behavior at the expense of abstractive reasoning and synthesis, which are key capabilities of LLMs.
- **Overly Complex and Brittle Methodology:** The two-stage pipeline has many moving parts, hyperparameters, and dependencies on other LLMs (as judges), making it potentially difficult to reproduce reliably and sensitive to component choices.
- **Unjustified Analysis Method:** The "Context-Parameter Copying Capturing" algorithm and its associated "logits power" metric are built on poorly justified heuristics, weakening the credibility of the mechanistic claims derived from them.
- **Missing Key Information:** The absence of Tables 1 and 2 in the main text is a major presentation weakness.

**Questions**
1.  Could you provide an ablation study on the components of your data generation pipeline (Algorithm 2)? Specifically, how important are the multi-criteria filtering, the Elo tournament, and the "answer stamping" steps for the final performance?
2.  How does your method handle queries that require synthesis or abstractive reasoning from multiple pieces of information in the context, where direct copying of sentences would be insufficient or lead to a disfluent answer?
3.  Can you provide a justification for the "logits power" formula (Eq. 2)? How does it compare to more standard metrics like token probabilities or entropy for analyzing model confidence?
4.  What is the precise definition of "meaningless tokens" used in Algorithm 3, and how sensitive is the analysis to this definition?

**Rating**
- Overall (10): 5 — The paper has impressive results but rests on a questionable core assumption and uses an overly complex, brittle methodology with a weakly justified analysis.
- Novelty (10): 7 — The idea of using DPO to train for "copying preference" is novel, but the underlying concept is related to extractive methods.
- Technical Quality (10): 4 — The technical quality is undermined by the complexity, the strong assumptions, and the poorly justified analysis algorithm and metrics.
- Clarity (10): 6 — The paper is mostly readable, but the missing tables and lack of justification for key methodological choices are significant clarity issues.
- Confidence (5): 4 — I am reasonably confident in my assessment, but a full evaluation of the technical quality is hampered by the missing details.

### **Review 3**

**Summary**
This paper introduces CopyPasteLLM, a framework designed to make Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems more reliable by reducing hallucinations. The core idea is to train the language model to favor responses that directly copy text from the provided context, based on the observation that more copying correlates with fewer hallucinations. The method uses a two-stage process: first, it generates high-copying responses using several prompting strategies; second, it uses these responses in an automated DPO pipeline to teach the model to prefer this "copy-paste" behavior. The authors report significant improvements in contextual faithfulness, particularly on counterfactual benchmarks, with very high data efficiency. An analysis suggests the method works by making the model trust the context more by suppressing its reliance on its own internal knowledge.

**Soundness**
The approach is pragmatic and grounded in a clear, intuitive principle. The two-stage pipeline is a sensible way to instill a desired behavior: generate examples of the behavior, then train the model to prefer them. The use of DPO is appropriate for this task. The automated data creation process, while complex, is a practical solution to avoid costly human labeling. The inclusion of different prompting strategies (CP-Order, CP-Link, CP-Refine) is a good design choice, as it allows for the generation of a diverse set of "good" examples that balance strict copying with fluency. The results, especially the dramatic gains on FaithEval (Section 4.1.2), strongly support the method's effectiveness in scenarios where context conflicts with parametric knowledge. The analysis in Section 4.2, showing a shift away from parametric knowledge, provides a plausible mechanism for the observed improvements.

**Presentation**
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The motivation, especially concerning high-stakes domains like medicine (Section 1), is compelling and effectively frames the importance of the problem. The figures are generally helpful, with Figure 2 providing a clear visual summary of the entire pipeline. The writing is clear and concise. The authors have also included a dedicated Ethics Statement (Section 7) and a detailed Reproducibility Statement (Section 8), which is commendable. The appendices are thorough, providing the prompts and algorithm details needed to understand the implementation. The main text is missing Tables 1 and 2, which is an unfortunate oversight, but the textual descriptions of the results are sufficient to grasp the key outcomes.

**Contribution**
The primary contribution is a practical and highly effective method for improving the faithfulness of RAG systems. The "copy-paste" paradigm offers an elegant solution that not only enhances faithfulness but also provides inherent attribution, a major challenge for many RAG systems. The demonstration that this can be achieved with extreme data efficiency (365 samples) is a significant finding for the field, suggesting that targeted behavioral fine-tuning can be a powerful alternative to large-scale data collection. The work provides a complete, end-to-end, and automated framework that could be readily applied in practice.

**Strengths**
- **Practicality and Applicability:** The method addresses a critical real-world problem in RAG systems. The automated nature of the data pipeline and the low data requirement make it highly practical for deployment.
- **Inherent Attribution:** By encouraging direct copying, the generated responses are self-attributing. A user or downstream system can easily trace a statement back to its source in the context, which is a huge benefit for trust and verification.
- **Strong Performance in High-Conflict Scenarios:** The method excels when the provided context is counterfactual or conflicts with the model's prior knowledge. This is precisely the scenario where RAG systems are most likely to fail, making the contribution particularly impactful.
- **Thoughtful Discussion of Limitations and Ethics:** The authors responsibly discuss the limitations of their approach, such as its dependence on context quality (Section G) and the risk of propagating biases from the source material (Section 7).

**Weaknesses**
- **Potential for Reduced Fluency and Over-Extraction:** The strong emphasis on copying might lead to responses that are less natural or fluent than abstractive summaries. While CP-Refine aims to balance this, the final CopyPasteLLM might still exhibit a bias towards choppy, extractive answers. The paper acknowledges this for the prompting methods but could analyze it more for the final fine-tuned model.
- **Dependence on High-Quality Context:** As noted in the limitations (Section G), the method's performance is fundamentally capped by the quality of the retrieved context. If the context is noisy, biased, or incorrect, the model will faithfully reproduce that flawed information. This "garbage in, garbage out" problem is amplified by a copy-paste strategy.
- **Limited Scope of Evaluation on Creative/Synthesis Tasks:** The evaluation focuses on QA tasks where answers are often found directly in the text. It's unclear how this method would fare on tasks requiring more creativity, inference, or synthesis of information from disparate parts of the context, where a purely extractive strategy is suboptimal.

**Questions**
1.  In your view, what is the ideal balance between copying (for faithfulness) and paraphrasing (for fluency and summarization)? Does your CP-Refine method offer a way to control this trade-off, perhaps by adjusting the threshold `θ_σ` in Algorithm 1?
2.  Have you considered a hybrid approach where the model first uses CopyPasteLLM to generate a faithful, evidence-grounded draft, and then a second-stage model refines this draft for fluency and style?
3.  The method seems particularly well-suited for domains like legal or medical QA where verbatim evidence is crucial. Are there domains where you think this approach would be unsuitable or even detrimental?
4.  The paper mentions that copied content serves as "direct evidence of faithfulness without requiring additional verifiable attribution mechanism" (Section 1). While true for tracing content to the *provided context*, how do you see this interacting with the broader problem of verifying the context itself?

**Rating**
- Overall (10): 8 — A highly practical and effective solution to a critical problem, with impressive results and a clear path to real-world application.
- Novelty (10): 8 — The framing of faithfulness as a "copying preference" for DPO is a novel and pragmatic take on the problem.
- Technical Quality (10): 8 — The method is well-designed and the empirical validation is strong, though the evaluation could be broader.
- Clarity (10): 8 — The paper is very clearly written and presented, with the exception of the missing tables.
- Confidence (5): 5 — I am confident in my evaluation. The paper is clear about its goals, methods, and results.

### **Review 4**

**Summary**
This paper investigates the link between response copying and contextual faithfulness in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The authors propose CopyPasteLLM, a model fine-tuned with DPO to prefer high-copying responses, which they argue mitigates hallucinations. The training data is generated via an automated pipeline that uses three "CopyPaste-Prompting" methods to create candidate responses. A key part of the paper is a mechanistic analysis of CopyPasteLLM's behavior using a novel probing tool, the "Context-Parameter Copying Capturing" algorithm. This analysis suggests that the fine-tuning process works by recalibrating the model's confidence in its internal parametric knowledge, rather than by altering its representation of contextual knowledge. The method shows strong performance on faithfulness benchmarks with high data efficiency.

**Soundness**
The paper's overall research design is sound, moving from an initial observation (Figure 1) to a method (CopyPasteLLM) and then to a mechanistic explanation (Section 4.2). The DPO-based training approach is standard and well-suited for the task.

My main focus is on the interpretability aspect. The proposed "Context-Parameter Copying Capturing" algorithm (Algorithm 3) is presented as a principled extension of KTC (Bi et al., 2024). However, it has several heuristic elements that weaken its claim to being a "principled" probe.
1.  **Knowledge Source Attribution:** Attributing a token to "contextual knowledge" simply because it appears in the context (line 12) is a coarse approximation. A token could appear in the context but be generated due to a parametric prior. Similarly, attributing a token to "parametric knowledge" because it appears in a context-free generation (line 15) is also a heuristic. The model's internal reasoning could be more complex.
2.  **Undefined Components:** The algorithm relies on an undefined `isMeaningless()` function (line 8). The choice of what to filter here (e.g., stop words, punctuation) could significantly bias the analysis, but this is not discussed.
3.  **Logits Power Metric:** The analysis in Figure 3 relies on a custom "logits power" metric (Eq. 2, Appendix I). The paper provides no theoretical or empirical justification for this specific formula (`(sum of squared logits) * sqrt(n)`). Why not use a more standard and interpretable metric like average log probability or entropy? Without this justification, the y-axis of the plots in Figure 3 is arbitrary and the conclusions drawn are less rigorous.

Despite these issues with the probe itself, the analysis of the hidden states in Figure 4 is more compelling. The use of UMAP to visualize the separation of knowledge representations is a standard and effective technique. The key finding here—that contextual representations remain co-distributed while parametric ones diverge (columns 3 and 4)—is a strong piece of evidence for the paper's central mechanistic claim and is the most convincing part of the analysis.

**Presentation**
The paper is well-written and the structure is logical. The interpretability analysis is presented as a core part of the contribution, which is excellent. Figure 4 is particularly effective; the pairwise comparison layout with marginal distributions clearly illustrates the paper's main mechanistic finding. However, Figure 3 is less clear due to the unmotivated "Logits Power" metric. The description of the Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm is clear, but it omits crucial details like the `isMeaningless` function, which hinders a full assessment of its validity. The appendix is comprehensive, which is a major plus for reproducibility.

**Contribution**
The paper's primary contribution is the CopyPasteLLM method itself. However, it also makes a significant attempt at a mechanistic contribution through its interpretability analysis. The most novel insight comes from the hidden state analysis (Figure 4), which suggests that faithfulness can be improved by *suppressing* reliance on parametric knowledge rather than *enhancing* the processing of contextual knowledge. This is an important distinction and a valuable contribution to our understanding of how fine-tuning affects model behavior.

The Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm is presented as a novel contribution. It does extend prior work (KTC) to the full CoT sequence, which is a useful step. However, its methodological weaknesses (heuristic design, lack of justification for metrics) limit its contribution as a standalone, principled analysis tool. Its value is primarily as a means to an end within this specific paper.

**Strengths**
- **Mechanistic Claim with Evidence:** The paper doesn't just present a black-box method; it proposes a clear mechanistic hypothesis (recalibration of parametric knowledge) and provides supporting evidence from both logits (Figure 3) and hidden states (Figure 4).
- **Strong Hidden State Analysis:** The UMAP visualization in Figure 4 is a high-quality piece of analysis that provides clear, interpretable evidence for the paper's core claim about how the model changes post-training.
- **Extension of Probing to CoT:** Applying knowledge source analysis to the entire Chain-of-Thought generation process, rather than just the final answer, is a valuable extension and allows for a more fine-grained view of the model's reasoning process.

**Weaknesses**
- **Weak Justification for Analysis Algorithm:** The Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm and its associated metrics are heuristic and not well-justified, which reduces the rigor of the analysis built upon them.
- **Superficial Logit Analysis:** The "logits power" analysis is difficult to interpret and feels less insightful than the hidden state analysis. A more standard analysis of token probabilities or rank changes could have been more convincing.
- **Potential Overstatement of "Recalibration":** The paper concludes that the model "recalibrates the model’s internal confidence in parametric knowledge" (Section 4.2). While the evidence points in this direction, this is a strong claim based on correlational analysis of hidden states and logits. The analysis doesn't fully rule out other potential mechanisms.

**Questions**
1.  Could you provide a rationale for the specific formula used for "logits power" in Equation 2? Have you compared it against other metrics like mean log-probability, and do the conclusions still hold?
2.  The analysis in Figure 4 suggests that the representation of contextual knowledge is largely unchanged between the base model and CopyPasteLLM. This is an interesting finding. Does this imply that the base instruction-tuned models already represent context "correctly" and the main failure point is in the final decision-making/softmax layer where parametric knowledge competes?
3.  Your algorithm distinguishes between contextual and parametric knowledge based on token presence. How would it handle a situation where the model generates a synonym of a word found in the context? Would this be incorrectly classified as parametric knowledge, and how would that affect your analysis?
4.  The analysis in Section 5.4 of the appendix mentions looking at attention heads and FFNs as future work. Based on your current findings, do you have a hypothesis about which components would be most affected by CopyPasteLLM training? For example, would you expect to see changes in attention to the context vs. self-attention in later layers?

**Rating**
- Overall (10): 7 — A solid paper with a strong primary method and an interesting, though partially flawed, mechanistic analysis.
- Novelty (10): 7 — The method is novel, and the mechanistic insight about suppressing parametric knowledge is a valuable contribution.
- Technical Quality (10): 6 — The quality of the main method is high, but the technical quality of the interpretability analysis is mixed, with the hidden state analysis being strong and the logit/probe analysis being weaker.
- Clarity (10): 8 — The paper is clearly written, but the justification for the analysis metrics is lacking.
- Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, particularly regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the interpretability analysis.
