          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions, namely the novel two-stage framework using lexical copying as a proxy for faithfulness, and highlight identical primary strengths such as high data efficiency and strong empirical results. The alignment is very high, with only minor differences in emphasis on aspects like reproducibility.",
          "weakness": "There is strong overlap on major conceptual weaknesses, including the correlational nature of the core claim, the limits of a purely lexical proxy, and the over-reliance on automated evaluation instead of human judgment. Review B adds more specific critiques about an outdated metric and reporting inconsistencies, while Review A gives more weight to the idealized context assumption.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in substance, both portraying the paper as a strong practical contribution with impressive data efficiency but notable caveats regarding its foundational claims and evaluation rigor. Their overall judgment is very consistent, with differences primarily in the granularity of secondary critiques rather than the main assessment."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the novel insight of using lexical copying for faithfulness, the method's data efficiency, the comprehensive evaluation, and the interpretability analysis. Review B provides more granular detail on these points, but the fundamental praise is highly aligned.",
          "weakness": "There is low alignment on weaknesses, as Review B's primary critiques focus on missing tables and a lack of quantitative evidence for core claims, which are entirely absent from Review A. While both touch upon the limits of lexical copying as a proxy for faithfulness, Review A's other points are high-level conceptual limitations, whereas Review B focuses on specific, severe methodological and reproducibility flaws.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's strengths but diverge significantly on its weaknesses, resulting in a moderate overall match. Review A sees a conceptually strong paper with some limitations, while Review B identifies major gaps in the empirical evidence presented, leading to a different focus and judgment on the paper's soundness."

Review B provides much more granular detail, but the key points and priorities are highly aligned with Review A.",
          "weakness": "The reviews share high-level concerns about lexical copying being an imperfect proxy for semantic faithfulness and the lack of human validation. However, Review B identifies numerous major, concrete flaws completely missed by Review A, including missing tables, numerical inconsistencies, and uncalibrated methodologies, resulting in low alignment.",
          "overall": "While both reviews agree on the paper's promising core idea and contributions, they diverge significantly in their assessment of its weaknesses and rigor. Review A focuses on conceptual limitations, whereas Review B provides a detailed critique of missing evidence and methodological flaws, leading to a more critical overall judgment and only moderate substantive alignment."
