          "strength": "Both reviews perfectly identify the same core strengths: the function-centric reframing, the broad empirical scope across tasks and models, the inclusion of safety-relevant metrics (calibration, robustness), and the key finding that regularization can increase sharpness while improving performance.",
          "weakness": "There is strong alignment on the most critical weaknesses, including confounding factors in sharpness measurement (e.g., data dependence due to augmentation), overstated claims about adversarial robustness, and limited novelty. Review B provides more granular examples of the measurement issues (e.g., ρ-dependence, correlation with loss), but these directly support the high-level concerns raised in Review A.",
          "overall": "The overall judgment is highly consistent, portraying the paper as having a valuable perspective and extensive experiments, but with conclusions weakened by significant methodological confounds and some overclaiming. The AI review's detailed critiques map directly onto the human review's broader concerns, resulting in a very similar assessment of the paper's substance and focus."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contribution (a \"function-centric\" view of sharpness) and highlight the same key strengths: the broad empirical scope, the inclusion of safety metrics, and the finding that regularization can increase sharpness. Review B provides more detail, but the substance and prioritization of strengths are nearly identical to Review A.",
          "weakness": "There is strong overlap on the most critical weaknesses, including the ambiguous definition of \"function complexity,\" limited novelty, and issues with comparing sharpness metrics across settings. Review A raises a few unique technical points (e.g., metric assumptions), while Review B provides a more granular breakdown of presentation issues like the conflation of robustness types.",
          "overall": "The overall judgment is highly consistent, as both reviews praise the paper's empirical scope and interesting hypothesis but criticize its lack of conceptual rigor and methodological clarity. The core narrative and focus are the same, with differences primarily in the level of detail rather than substance."

The focus and substance are largely consistent, with differences primarily in the level of detail and a few secondary critiques."
