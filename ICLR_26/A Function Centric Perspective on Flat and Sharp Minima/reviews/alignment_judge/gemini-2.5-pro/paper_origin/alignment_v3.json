However, there is a fundamental disagreement on the paper's core contribution: humans critique the main hypothesis as 'not new' and the toy experiments (Section 4) as 'misleading' or flawed, whereas the AI praises both as key strengths. Additionally, the AI misses major human concerns regarding Simpson's paradox in the results and the violation of the locally constant labels assumption."
