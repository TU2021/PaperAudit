### Summary

The paper proposes a **Quadratic Direct Forecast (QDF)** method designed to improve the training objectives for **multi-step time-series forecasting models**. Existing methods often fail to account for **label autocorrelation** (temporal dependencies between future steps) and **heterogeneous task weights** (the varying importance of different forecasting tasks). QDF addresses these issues by using a **quadratic-form weighted training objective**, where the off-diagonal elements of the weighting matrix model the **label autocorrelation** and the diagonal elements adaptively adjust the weights for different forecasting tasks. The authors introduce a **QDF learning algorithm**, which optimizes the forecasting model using this **adaptive quadratic-form matrix**. The paper demonstrates that **QDF** improves forecasting accuracy across multiple models and datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths

1. **Novel and Relevant Approach**:

   * The method provides a novel **quadratic-form weighted objective** that addresses key challenges in time-series forecasting: label autocorrelation and varying task weights.

2. **Theoretical Motivation**:

   * The paper is well-motivated both empirically and theoretically, discussing the shortcomings of existing forecasting objectives and explaining how QDF resolves these limitations.

3. **Comprehensive Experiments**:

   * The paper includes **rigorous experiments** comparing **QDF** against existing methods and demonstrating its superiority on several forecasting datasets. It also provides **ablation studies** to understand the contribution of different components.

4. **Reproducibility**:

   * The authors provide **open-source code** to facilitate replication and further exploration of their approach.

### Weaknesses

1. **Insufficient Theoretical Exploration**:

   * While the paper discusses the quadratic-form objective, it lacks a deeper **theoretical exploration** of why the proposed weighting matrix improves existing methods like **FreDF** and **Time-o1**. The authors could improve the paper by deriving and analyzing the advantages of **QDF** over these methods.

2. **Clarity in Data Splitting and Leakage Prevention**:

   * The **data splitting strategy** could be explained more clearly to ensure there is no risk of **data leakage**, particularly when using **meta-update** strategies. A detailed analysis is needed to confirm that the proposed methods do not inadvertently leak information from validation or test sets.

3. **Computational Efficiency**:

   * **QDF's computational cost** may be a concern due to the **bilevel optimization** process. Although the authors claim efficiency, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed analysis on the **scalability** of QDF, particularly for large datasets and high-dimensional time-series problems.

4. **Code Reproducibility**:

   * While the authors have released code, the **introduction to key components** is lacking. Clear instructions are needed on **how to reproduce the results**, including **hyperparameters**, code structure, and required **software environment**.
