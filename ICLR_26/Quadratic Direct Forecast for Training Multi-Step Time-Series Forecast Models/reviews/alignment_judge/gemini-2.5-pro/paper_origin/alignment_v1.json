          "strength": "Both reviews perfectly align on the paper's core contribution, identifying the novel quadratic objective for handling label autocorrelation and heterogeneous task weights as the main strength. They also both praise the comprehensive experiments and strong empirical motivation.",

However, Review B identifies several specific and critical technical flaws (e.g., the omitted log|Σ| term, bilevel implementation ambiguity) that Review A misses, while Review A raises a unique concern about potential data leakage.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's strengths but diverge on the nature and severity of its weaknesses, leading to a moderate overall match. While both see a valuable contribution, Review B's critique of the method's technical soundness is much more specific and severe than Review A's more general call for deeper analysis and clarity."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions (a quadratic objective for label autocorrelation and task weights) and praise the novelty and comprehensive experiments. Review B provides much greater detail, but the key points and their prioritization are almost identical to Review A.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on two main points: the lack of deep theoretical guarantees and concerns about computational efficiency. However, Review B identifies several additional major weaknesses missed by Review A, including the restrictive treatment of multivariate data and ambiguity in the core bilevel optimization algorithm.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's strengths and core idea, but only moderate alignment on its weaknesses, where Review B is substantially more critical and detailed. While both see the paper as a valuable contribution, their judgment on its technical soundness and specific flaws diverges significantly."

          "weakness": "There is a small overlap on general concerns like insufficient theory and computational cost, but Review B identifies many more severe and specific technical flaws that Review A misses, such as the incorrect likelihood objective, ambiguous bilevel optimization, and limitations in the multivariate setting.",

Review A offers a high-level critique, while Review B performs a deep, technical audit, resulting in a different focus and a more critical judgment of the paper's execution and soundness."
