Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several major internal inconsistencies and discrepancies have been identified that materially affect the validity and trustworthiness of the paper's claims.

### Integrity Risk and Inconsistency Report

**1. Inconsistency in the "10x Speedup" Claim and Experimental Protocol**

The paper prominently claims "up to 10x speedups over existing algorithms" (Section 1, Block #6) and illustrates this with the right panel of Figure 1 (Block #7). However, this claim is based on an experimental setup that is inconsistent with the main evaluation protocol used throughout the rest of the paper.

*   **Evidence**: The "Language Model (XFormer)" plot in Figure 1 shows results for up to **100 evaluations**. In contrast, the main experimental protocol, as described in Section 5.1 (Block #20), states: "Each optimizer-benchmark-seed combination was run for 20 equivalent full function evaluations". All primary results, including the main relative rank plots (Figure 3, Block #27) and per-benchmark hypervolume plots (Figure 4, Block #30), adhere to this 20-evaluation budget.
*   **Problem**: The key marketing claim of a "10x speedup" is substantiated only by a single "hero plot" that uses a 5-fold larger budget than the systematic evaluation. This benchmark is also not clearly listed or detailed among the 8 benchmarks described in Section 5.1 and Appendix F (Block #65, #68). This discrepancy raises concerns about cherry-picking results from a non-standard experimental setup to support a headline claim.

**2. Fundamental Contradiction in the Core Multi-Objective Optimization Method**

There is a critical contradiction between the textual description of the optimization strategy and the formal algorithm definition, which calls into question whether PriMO operates as a true multi-objective optimizer.

*   **Evidence**:
    *   The text in Section 4.1 (Block #13) describes converting the vector-valued objective into a single objective "using a linear scalarization function ... with randomly sampled weights," which implies the standard multi-objective technique of re-sampling weights at each iteration to explore the Pareto front.
    *   However, **Algorithm 3 (PriMO)** (Block #17) explicitly shows that the weights `w` are sampled **only once** at the beginning of the optimization (line 3). This same fixed weight vector `w` is then used for the entire duration of the run to scalarize objective values (line 10).
*   **Problem**: Optimizing with a single, fixed scalarization vector does not explore the Pareto front; it converts the multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem that aims for only one point on the front. This contradicts the fundamental goal of multi-objective optimization. The algorithm as written does not match the description of the technique it claims to use, undermining its central claim of being a multi-objective HPO algorithm.

**3. Misrepresentation of Ablation Study Results**

The textual summary of the ablation study in Section 5.5 misrepresents the results shown in the corresponding figure.

*   **Evidence**:
    *   Section 5.5 (Block #34) states: "**PriMO without Priors** and PriMO without ϵ-BO are two of the **worst performing ablations overall**".
    *   **Figure 7** (and its duplicate, Figure 41) shows the performance of PriMO's ablations. The curve for "PriMO w/o Priors" (blue line in Figure 41) is clearly one of the **best-performing** variants. In the "Overall" panel, it achieves a final rank of ~2.2, second only to the full PriMO model (~1.8) and significantly better than "PriMO w/o ε-BO" (yellow line, final rank > 4.0).
*   **Problem**: The text makes a claim that is directly contradicted by the visual evidence in the paper's own figure. The "PriMO w/o Priors" ablation is actually a very strong performer, which weakens the paper's argument about the absolute necessity of the prior-based components.

**4. Contradictory Explanation of a Key Baseline's Performance**

The paper's explanation for the poor performance of the `πBO+RW` baseline under misleading priors is inconsistent with the implementation details provided in the appendix.

*   **Evidence**:
    *   Appendix H.2 (Block #77) attributes `πBO+RW`'s failure to its "slow decay schedule," which causes it to rely on bad priors for too long.
    *   However, Appendix E.1 (Block #61) explicitly states that the implementation of `πBO` used is from the NePS package, where the decay schedule `γ` is set to `e^{-n_{BO}/n_d}`. This is a fast exponential decay, not the slow `β/n` decay from the original `πBO` paper that the narrative relies on. In fact, PriMO's own decay schedule (`e^{-n_{BO}^2/n_d}`) is just a faster version of the same functional form.
*   **Problem**: The paper constructs a narrative based on a "strawman" version of a key baseline. The explanation provided for the baseline's failure is inconsistent with the details of the version of the baseline that was actually run in the experiments.

**5. Misinterpretation of Statistical Significance Results**

The textual description of the statistical analysis in Appendix I.2 misinterprets the results presented in the Critical Difference (CD) diagrams.

*   **Evidence**:
    *   For the "All priors bad" condition at 20 evaluations, the text in Appendix I.2 (Block #86) claims: "...with the notable exception of BO+RW, PriMO is shown to be **significantly better than all baselines**."
    *   The corresponding CD diagram in **Figure 14** (and its low-resolution duplicate in Block #97) shows that PriMO is ranked **below** BO+RW, ParEGO, MOASHA, and HB+RW. Furthermore, the horizontal bars indicating groups of statistically indistinguishable methods show that PriMO's performance is **not significantly different** from ParEGO, MOASHA, and HB+RW. It is only significantly better than the worst-performing algorithms (RS, NSGA-II, MO-PB, and πBO+RW).
*   **Problem**: The claim of being "significantly better than all baselines" (except one) is a clear misrepresentation of the statistical evidence presented in the paper's own figure.

### Conclusion

The manuscript contains multiple high-impact inconsistencies, including a misleading headline claim based on a non-standard setup, a fundamental contradiction in the core algorithm's design, and clear misrepresentations of both ablation and statistical results. These issues severely undermine the scientific validity and trustworthiness of the paper's conclusions.
