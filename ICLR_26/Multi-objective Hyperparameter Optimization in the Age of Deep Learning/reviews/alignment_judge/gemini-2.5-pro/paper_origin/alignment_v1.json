The alignment is very high, with only minor differences in emphasis, such as Review A highlighting a specific case study while Review B notes the public code.",
          "weakness": "There is overlap on the lack of theoretical analysis for the method and concerns about how priors are defined, but Review B introduces major, distinct critiques absent from Review A, such as the missing state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., qEHVI) and the reliance on surrogate-only benchmarks.",
          "overall": "The reviews align well on the paper's core contribution and strengths, but diverge significantly in their assessment of the experimental rigor. Review A accepts the empirical results as state-of-the-art, whereas Review B is more critical of the methodology (baselines, surrogates, prior construction), leading to a more qualified judgment and only moderate overall alignment."

The AI review adds more granular points on reproducibility and statistical rigor, but the main contributions highlighted are nearly identical.",
          "weakness": "There is moderate overlap, with both reviews pointing out the lack of theoretical analysis and issues with how priors are defined and handled. However, the AI review identifies several additional major weaknesses missed by the human, including the omission of key baselines (e.g., EHVI), potential fairness issues in the experimental protocol, and the unrealistic construction of priors for the experiments.",
          "overall": "The reviews align well on the paper's core contribution and strengths, leading to a similar positive overall assessment. However, they diverge on the depth of the experimental critique, with the AI review raising several significant concerns about the evaluation that are absent from the human review, resulting in only a partial alignment of their substantive judgment on the paper's weaknesses."

Review A offers high-level critiques while Review B provides a much more detailed and critical analysis of the experimental methodology, leading to a different overall judgment on the paper's soundness."
