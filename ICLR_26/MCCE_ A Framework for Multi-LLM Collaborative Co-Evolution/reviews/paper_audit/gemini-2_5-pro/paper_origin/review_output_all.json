This two-way improvement is a significant strength of the framework.3) Weaknesses\n*   **Lack of Clarity in Key \"Co-evolutionary Curve\" Visualizations:** The plots intended to visualize the collaborative dynamics between the two models are confusing and poorly explained, undermining a central piece of evidence for the \"co-evolution\" narrative.\n    *   In Figure 3 (Left), the plot shows two curves labeled \"qwen2.5-7b-instruct\" and \"gpt-4o-2024-05-13\". These labels correspond to the standalone baseline models in Table 1, making it appear as if the plot compares two independent runs rather than the interaction within a single MCCE system.\n    *   The caption and main text (Section 5.2.2) describe a dynamic interplay and complementarity, but the visualization does not clearly depict this. It is unclear what the y-axis (`avg_top1`) represents in the context of two interacting models.\n    *   This ambiguity is repeated in the additional plots in the Appendix (Figure 5), indicating a systematic issue with this form of visualization.*   **High Variance in Reported Results:** While the mean performance of MCCE is superior, the reported standard deviations for the primary metric (Hypervolume) are very high across all methods, which weakens the claims of significant improvement.\n    *   In Table 1, the best-performing method (`dpo_coevolve`) has a Hypervolume of `0.847 ± 0.138`. The second-best method (`rl_coevolve`) has `0.709 ± 0.219`. The large standard deviations suggest a substantial overlap in the performance distributions.\n    *   The paper makes strong claims about superiority (\"significantly surpasses all single-model baselines\") but does not provide any statistical significance tests (e.g., t-tests) to formally support these claims in light of the high variance.\n    *   The source of this high variance is not discussed, leaving open questions about the stability and robustness of the optimization process across different runs.*   **Missing Implementation Details on Model Alternation:** The paper states that the LLM operator \"alternates between a frozen API model and a locally trainable model\" (Section 4.1), but the specific strategy for this alternation is not described.\n    *   It is unclear how the workload is divided between the two models. Is it a fixed 50/50 split for generating new candidates in each generation? Is it an adaptive strategy?\n    *   This is a critical hyperparameter of the framework that governs the balance between exploration (API model) and exploitation (local model), and its omission hinders reproducibility and a full understanding of the method's dynamics. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.*   **Limited Comparison to External State-of-the-Art Methods:** The experimental comparison is largely internal, focusing on ablations of the MCCE framework (different training methods) and single-model baselines. The comparison to the broader state-of-the-art in LLM-based molecular optimization is limited.\n    *   The related work section (Section 2) discusses several other relevant approaches (e.g., FunSearch, EoH), but these are not included as experimental baselines.\n    *   While the paper builds on prior work like ExLLM and MoLLEO (Section 1), a direct quantitative comparison to other contemporary methods would better situate the performance of MCCE and strengthen its claim of achieving state-of-the-art results.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Revise and Clarify the Co-evolutionary Curve Visualizations:** The authors should completely revise the plots in Figure 3 (Left) and Figure 5 to make them interpretable.\n    *   The legend should be changed to accurately reflect what is being plotted. For example, if the curves represent the quality of candidates generated by each model type *within a single MCCE run*, the labels should be explicit (e.g., \"API-generated candidates in MCCE\", \"Local model-generated candidates in MCCE\").\n    *   The caption and the corresponding text in Section 5.2.2 must be rewritten to unambiguously explain what the plot shows and how it supports the claim of collaborative improvement.\n    *   Consider an alternative visualization, such as plotting the population's Pareto front at different generations, color-coding the points by which model generated them.*   **Address and Analyze High Result Variance:** The authors should acknowledge the high variance in the results and provide a more rigorous statistical analysis.\n    *   Add statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests or a non-parametric equivalent like the Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to Table 1 to compare `dpo_coevolve` against the main baselines. This would provide formal evidence for the claimed improvements.\n    *   Include a brief discussion in the results section (Section 5.2) about the potential sources of this variance (e.g., stochasticity of LLM outputs, sensitivity to the initial population) and its implications for the method's robustness.*   **Specify the Model Alternation Strategy:** The manuscript should be updated to include the missing details about how the two LLM operators are alternated.\n    *   In Section 4.1, explicitly state the strategy used in the experiments. For example: \"In each generation, we generate M/2 new pairs of candidates. For each pair, the operator (API or local model) is chosen uniformly at random,\" or \"we assign 50% of the parent pairs to the API model and 50% to the local model.\"\n    *   This detail is essential for reproducibility and for other researchers to build upon this work.*   **Broaden the Set of Experimental Baselines:** To better contextualize the results, the authors should consider adding at least one strong, external baseline from the recent literature on LLM-based optimization.\n    *   If computationally feasible, implementing and comparing against a non-evolutionary LLM optimization method or a different LLM-based evolutionary approach cited in Section 2 would make the claim of \"state-of-the-art performance\" more convincing.\n    *   If direct implementation is not possible, a thorough discussion comparing MCCE's results to those reported in other relevant papers on the same or similar benchmarks would be a valuable addition.5) Score\n- Overall (10): 8 — The paper presents a novel, well-motivated framework with a strong technical contribution and impressive results, though clarity issues in key figures and high result variance need to be addressed.\n- Novelty (10): 9 — The concept of co-evolving a frozen API model with a trainable local model via similarity-stabilized DPO is a highly novel and impactful idea for LLM-based optimization.\n- Technical Quality (10): 8 — The methodical development of the DPO-based learning paradigm is excellent (Section 4.2, 4.3), but the high variance in results (Table 1) and missing implementation details slightly reduce the technical quality.\n- Clarity (10): 7 — The paper is generally well-written, but the confusing \"co-evolutionary curve\" visualizations (Figure 3 Left, Figure 5) and the omission of the model alternation strategy significantly hinder clarity and reproducibility.\n- Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, having thoroughly reviewed the methodology, results, and appendices.",

The comparison to the broader state-of-the-art in LLM-based molecular optimization is limited.\n    *   The related work section (Section 2) discusses several other relevant approaches (e.g., FunSearch, EoH), but these are not included as experimental baselines.\n    *   While the paper builds on prior work like ExLLM and MoLLEO (Section 1), a direct quantitative comparison to other contemporary methods would better situate the performance of MCCE and strengthen its claim of achieving state-of-the-art results.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Correct and Align Co-evolution Visualizations and Descriptions:** The authors must address the severe discrepancy between the text and the figures related to the \"co-evolutionary curve.\"\n    *   The text in Section 5.2.2 and Appendix A.5 must be rewritten to accurately describe what the plots in Figure 3 (Left) and Figure 5 actually show (i.e., a comparison of independent baseline runs).\n    *   Alternatively, the authors should replace these plots with new visualizations that genuinely depict the collaborative dynamics within a single MCCE run as described in the text. For example, plotting the performance of candidates generated by the API model versus the local model *within the same run* would be appropriate.\n    *   This correction is critical for the integrity of the paper's evidentiary basis.*   **Address and Analyze High Result Variance:** The authors should acknowledge the high variance in the results and provide a more rigorous statistical analysis.\n    *   Add statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests or a non-parametric equivalent like the Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to Table 1 to compare `dpo_coevolve` against the main baselines. This would provide formal evidence for the claimed improvements.\n    *   Include a brief discussion in the results section (Section 5.2) about the potential sources of this variance (e.g., stochasticity of LLM outputs, sensitivity to the initial population) and its implications for the method's robustness.*   **Specify the Model Alternation Strategy:** The manuscript should be updated to include the missing details about how the two LLM operators are alternated.\n    *   In Section 4.1, explicitly state the strategy used in the experiments. For example: \"In each generation, we generate M/2 new pairs of candidates. For each pair, the operator (API or local model) is chosen uniformly at random,\" or \"we assign 50% of the parent pairs to the API model and 50% to the local model.\"\n    *   This detail is essential for reproducibility and for other researchers to build upon this work.*   **Broaden the Set of Experimental Baselines:** To better contextualize the results, the authors should consider adding at least one strong, external baseline from the recent literature on LLM-based optimization.\n    *   If computationally feasible, implementing and comparing against a non-evolutionary LLM optimization method or a different LLM-based evolutionary approach cited in Section 2 would make the claim of \"state-of-the-art performance\" more convincing.\n    *   If direct implementation is not possible, a thorough discussion comparing MCCE's results to those reported in other relevant papers on the same or similar benchmarks would be a valuable addition.5) Score\n- Overall (10): 6 — The paper presents a novel framework with a strong technical contribution, but the misrepresentation of key figures (Figure 3 Left, Figure 5) is a major flaw that damages the paper's credibility.\n- Novelty (10): 8 — The co-evolution of a frozen API model with a trainable local model via similarity-stabilized DPO is a highly novel implementation, though the core architectural concept has unacknowledged precedents.\n- Technical Quality (10): 6 — The DPO learning method is well-developed (Section 4.3), but the misrepresentation of figures as evidence (Section 5.2.2), high result variance (Table 1), and missing details severely reduce the technical quality.\n- Clarity (10): 4 — The paper is generally readable, but the direct contradiction between the text and the \"co-evolutionary curve\" visualizations (Figure 3 Left, Figure 5) makes this part of the paper actively misleading.\n- Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, having thoroughly reviewed the methodology, results, and appendices, and confirmed the inconsistencies."
