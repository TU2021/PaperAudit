**Manuscript Title:** MCCE: A FRAMEWORK FOR MULTI-LLM COLLABORATIVE CO-EVOLUTION

**Overall Assessment:**
This manuscript proposes an interesting and relevant framework, MCCE, for multi-objective optimization by combining a frozen, large language model (LLM) with a smaller, trainable one. The core idea of co-evolution through experience-driven learning is compelling. However, the manuscript contains critical internal inconsistencies between the textual descriptions of key results and the figures presented as evidence. These issues are not minor and fundamentally undermine the evidentiary basis for the central claims regarding the collaborative dynamics of the proposed system.

**Major Inconsistencies and Integrity Concerns:**

**1. Contradiction Between Textual Description and Visual Evidence for "Co-evolutionary Curves"**

A central claim of the paper is that the two models (frozen API and trainable local) engage in a productive, collaborative "co-evolution." This is purportedly demonstrated by "co-evolutionary curves." However, the figures provided do not match the detailed descriptions in the text.

*   **Evidence from Text:**
    *   **Section 5.2.2 (Block #31):** The text describes the left panel of Figure 3 as "The co-evolutionary curve." It claims this curve "captures the dynamics of how the frozen large LLM and the fine-tuned local model collaborate," shows the "alternating interplay between these two roles," and "clearly illustrates that their collaboration outperforms the trajectory of either model alone."
    *   **Appendix A.5 (Block #49):** The text introduces Figure 5 as containing "four additional co-evolutionary curves" that "consistently demonstrate the same trend observed in the main text," where "the collaborative trajectory consistently surpasses that of either model operating alone."

*   **Evidence from Figures:**
    *   **Figure 3 (Left), presented in Block #36:** This figure is titled "Curves of avg_top1 for multiple runs." It displays only two performance curves, one for `qwen2.5-7b-instruct` and one for `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`. This plot shows the performance of two baseline models running independently. It does **not** show a collaborative process, an "alternating interplay," or a combined trajectory that outperforms the individual components.
    *   **Figure 5, presented as four separate plots in Blocks #54, #55, #56, and #57:** All four plots are of the same type as the figure in Block #36. They each compare the independent performance of the same two baseline models. They are not "co-evolutionary curves" and do not provide evidence for the collaborative dynamics described in the text.

*   **Conclusion on Inconsistency:** There is a direct and irreconcilable contradiction between the detailed narrative provided in the text (Blocks #31, #49) and the actual content of the figures (Blocks #36, #54-57). The text describes figures that appear to be non-existent in the manuscript, while misrepresenting the provided baseline plots as evidence for a complex collaborative mechanism. This invalidates a key piece of evidence used to support the paper's core contribution.

**2. Inconsistent Figure Caption and Content**

There is a direct mismatch between the descriptive caption for Figure 3 and the figure's content.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Figure 3 Caption (Block #34):** The markdown table used to lay out Figure 3 contains a caption for the left panel: `
![Curves of avg top1 for multiple runs showing qwen2.5-7b-instruct, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, and dpo_coevolve performance...]`.
    *   **Figure 3 (Left)
 Content (Block #36):** The actual plot only contains curves for `qwen2.5-7b-instruct` and `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`. The `dpo_coevolve` curve, which is mentioned in the caption and is the paper's main proposed method, is absent from this figure.

*   **Conclusion on Inconsistency:** This discrepancy further confuses the presentation of results and suggests a lack of care in aligning the manuscript's text, captions, and figures.

**Summary of Concerns:**

The manuscript's primary weakness from an integrity and consistency standpoint is the severe disconnect between its narrative claims and the visual evidence provided. The paper repeatedly describes "co-evolutionary curves" that are supposed to be a cornerstone of its evidence, but the actual figures are simple baseline comparisons that do not support these descriptions. Presenting five such plots (one in the main text, four in the appendix) under this misleading description raises significant concerns about the manuscript's scientific rigor and trustworthiness. While other results in the paper (e.g., Table 1, Figure 2) appear to support the overall performance claims, the misrepresentation of the figures intended to illustrate the underlying *mechanism* is a critical flaw that must be addressed.
