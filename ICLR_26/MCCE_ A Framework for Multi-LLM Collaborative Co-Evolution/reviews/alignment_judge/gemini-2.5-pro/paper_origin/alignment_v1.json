          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the innovative hybrid co-evolutionary framework, the effective use of similarity-based DPO for stability, and the strong experimental results. The alignment is very high, with only minor differences in emphasis on secondary points like cost-effectiveness.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews agree on major weaknesses, including the limited baseline comparisons (naming MoLLEO/ExLLM), domain-specific evaluation, and lack of ablations. Review B provides a more detailed breakdown of reproducibility issues (e.g., ambiguous similarity function, missing HV/scoring details) which are covered more generally in Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, recognizing the paper's novel contribution but criticizing its evaluation for similar reasons. Review B's critique is more granular and technical, but the fundamental assessment of the paper's pros and cons is largely the same as Review A's."

However, they directly contradict each other on cost-effectiveness, with Review A listing it as a strength and Review B citing its absence as a weakness.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews agree on the need for better baseline comparisons, more ablation studies, and improved reproducibility. However, Review B is far more comprehensive, identifying several additional major weaknesses that Review A misses, such as under-specified metrics, negative trade-offs in diversity, and potential inconsistencies in the results data.",
          "overall": "The reviews align on the paper's central concept and share a similar high-level judgment: a promising idea with a flawed evaluation. However, the alignment is only moderate because Review B's critique is substantially deeper and broader, identifying numerous critical issues that are absent from the human review, leading to a more severe overall assessment."
