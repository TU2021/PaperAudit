    "explanation": {
      "strength": "Both reviews describe essentially the same core motivation and contributions: a hybrid multi-LLM co‑evolution framework (MCCE) that couples a frozen, closed‑source/global LLM with a lightweight, trainable local LLM; use of DPO (specifically similarity‑based DPO) on stored ‘breakthrough’ trajectories to stabilize learning and mitigate instability of SFT/RL; and application to multi‑objective molecular design with strong performance and Pareto/hypervolume improvements over baselines. They both highlight the novelty of the collaborative hybrid design, the central role of similarity‑based DPO for stability, strong empirical performance on multi‑objective molecular optimization, and good clarity/organization of the method and diagrams. Review B adds more granular technical detail (metrics, equations, specific objectives) but is fully consistent with Review A’s high‑level strengths.",
      "weakness": "There is substantial overlap but not perfect. Clear alignment: both point out missing or limited baselines against recent LLM‑based evolutionary methods like ExLLM/MoLLEO and other strong optimizers; concerns about generality beyond the molecular design domain; and reproducibility/under‑specification of important algorithmic details (interaction protocol, alternation/update rules, etc.). Review B expands this into more specific issues: ambiguous definition of the similarity function used for DPO triplets, missing details on biochemical surrogate models for target scores, lack of hypervolume computation specifics, undefined secondary metrics (Top1F, AUC variants), and unclear explanation of the ‘mutual inspiration’ mechanism and alternation schedule. Review A instead emphasizes broader concerns like lack of component ablations, scalability/stability analysis, and feedback protocol formalization. These are compatible but only partially overlapping, hence a good but not perfect alignment on weaknesses.",
      "overall": "In substance and judgment, the two reviews are highly aligned. They agree on what the paper is about, what is novel (multi‑LLM co‑evolution plus similarity‑based DPO), and that the empirical results are strong and promising. They also converge on key reservations around baseline coverage, generality claims, and insufficient methodological detail/reproducibility, though Review B provides a more fine‑grained technical critique. The differences are mainly in level of detail and specific focal points, not in contradictory assessments. Hence overall alignment is high but not complete, dominated by strong convergence on strengths and moderately overlapping but differently granular weaknesses."

          "strength": "Both reviews agree that the core contribution is a hybrid multi-LLM co-evolution framework pairing a frozen global LLM with a trainable local LLM, refined via similarity-based DPO, and demonstrated on multi-objective molecular design and other discrete optimization tasks. They both emphasize the novelty of this architecture, the importance of similarity-based DPO for stable training, strong empirical gains over baselines, and clear presentation/diagrams with attention to reproducibility and cost/efficiency. Review B adds more detail on metric choices and loss dynamics, but these elaborate rather than contradict Review A’s core strength points.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews flag insufficient/limited baselines and weak support for state-of-the-art claims as a primary concern, and both mention incomplete generality beyond molecular design (Review A explicitly, Review B more implicitly via missing external methods but still focused on molecular tasks). They also converge on reproducibility/clarity gaps around experimental setup (protocols, metrics, update rules), and on missing deeper analysis/ablations of design choices such as DPO configuration and co-evolution behavior. Review B introduces additional, more granular concerns (metric definitions, diversity/validity trade-offs, cost reporting, mutual-inspiration wording) that are not present in Review A but are mostly refinements rather than shifts in core criticism.",
          "overall": "In substance, the two reviews are strongly aligned: they see the same central innovation (global–local hybrid with DPO-based co-evolution) and broadly similar main strengths (conceptual novelty, training stability, and strong internal empirical results with clear exposition). Their main critiques overlap on insufficient baselines and incomplete methodological/execution details, though Review B adds more fine-grained issues and more emphasis on metrics, diversity/validity, and cost. Overall judgments and focus are consistent, with differences largely in depth and granularity rather than direction."

Review B adds more detail on training-paradigm discussion and the 5-objective setting, while Review A uniquely emphasizes cost/efficiency and additional NP-hard combinatorial tasks, leading to some divergence in emphasis, including a direct disagreement on how well cost is reported.",
          "weakness": "The reviews align on key weaknesses around limited external baselines/SOTA support, the need for more detailed ablations/component analyses, and incomplete formalization of parts of the protocol affecting reproducibility. However, Review A raises concerns about domain generalization beyond molecular design and scalability/stability of the co-evolution loop that Review B does not echo, whereas Review B introduces several substantial additional critiques (under-specified metrics and predictors, diversity/validity trade-offs, ambiguity around ‘mutual inspiration,’ missing cost/runtime details, and metric/reporting inconsistencies) that are absent from Review A.",
          "overall": "Substantively, both reviews see the paper as a promising, well-motivated hybrid framework with meaningful empirical gains but weakened by gaps in evaluation and reproducibility, leading to a broadly similar positive-but-cautious judgment. Alignment is reduced because Review B is much more exhaustive and critical, surfacing many major issues not mentioned in Review A and directly contesting one of A’s claimed strengths (cost/efficiency reporting), so the overlap is solid but clearly short of near-complete agreement."
