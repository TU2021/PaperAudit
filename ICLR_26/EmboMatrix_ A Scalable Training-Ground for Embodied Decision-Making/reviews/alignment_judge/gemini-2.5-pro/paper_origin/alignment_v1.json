The alignment is very high, with similar emphasis on the paper's main contributions.",
          "weakness": "The reviews align on the key weakness of the pre-cached physics interface sacrificing fidelity, but diverge significantly elsewhere. Review A critiques overstated task diversity and lack of model generalization, while Review B focuses on numerical inconsistencies, reproducibility gaps, and reliance on AI evaluators.",
          "overall": "There is strong agreement on the paper's positive contributions and overall value, but the critiques come from different angles, leading to only partial substantive alignment. Review A focuses more on the generalizability of the scientific claims, whereas Review B is more concerned with reporting standards and reproducibility."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the innovative and scalable training system (EmboMatrix), the multi-agent data factory for task diversity, the hierarchical reward design, and strong empirical results. The alignment is very high, with Review B simply providing more granular evidence for the same points.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the critical limitations of the pre-cached physics interface (impacting fidelity and real-world transfer) and the lack of statistical rigor in evaluation. However, they diverge on other major points; Review A uniquely critiques the limited generalization across model families, while Review B focuses on biased LLM-based evaluators and reproducibility gaps.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, viewing the paper as a strong system with impressive results but significant weaknesses in evaluation and real-world applicability. While they agree almost perfectly on the paper's strengths, the moderate alignment on weaknesses prevents a higher overall score, as each review raises unique, important critiques."
