The problem addressed is that Large Language Models (LLMs), while strong at reasoning, lack the physical grounding necessary for embodied tasks, which cannot be effectively learned from static datasets. EmboMatrix is a comprehensive system featuring three main components: a multi-agent data factory for generating diverse tasks and scenes, a scalable distributed simulation backend for efficient interaction, and a hierarchical reward architecture for informative supervision. Using this system, the authors train EmboBrain, an LLM-based agent. The main results show that the 7B parameter EmboBrain, trained with EmboMatrix, significantly outperforms its base model and even surpasses much larger models like the 671B DeepSeek-R1 on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of interactive, environment-grounded learning.2) Strengths\n*   **Comprehensive and Well-Engineered System:** The paper presents a complete, end-to-end system that addresses the key challenges in training embodied agents at scale.

While this is a stated and necessary focus for scalability, the paper does not address the limitations of this approach or the challenges of transferring the learned skills to the real world.\n    *   The motivation (Section 1) highlights the cost and risk of real-world training, but the paper never returns to the topic of how the proposed simulation-based training might eventually bridge this gap.\n    *   The use of a pre-cached physics interface (Section 4.2, Appendix B.1), while crucial for efficiency, abstracts away fine-grained physical dynamics, which could potentially hinder sim-to-real transfer.\n    *   No direct evidence found in the manuscript of any discussion regarding potential negative societal impacts or the limitations imposed by operating purely in a simulated environment.*   **Clarity and Accessibility of Experimental Details:** Several key details necessary for a full understanding and potential replication of the experiments are either missing, relegated to the appendix, or contain errors.\n    *   The exact scale of the training data (e.g., total number of generated tasks and scenes used) is not specified in the main experimental setup (Section 5.1), only that it was procedurally generated from 45 base scenes.\n    *   The specific coefficients for the hierarchical reward function, which are critical for reproducing the learning algorithm, are only provided in Appendix C.\n    *   The full action space is defined only in Table 8 in the appendix, making it difficult to fully grasp the agent's capabilities from the main paper alone.\n    *   The text incorrectly references figures when discussing results; for example, Section 5.2.1 refers to Figure 5 for scene aesthetics, but the relevant visual evidence is in Figure 6.\n    *   Table 1 includes a baseline model named \"GPT-o1-mini\" without explanation, which does not correspond to a known public model, hindering the interpretation of that comparison.*   **Dependence on External High-Capability Models for Data Generation:** The data generation pipeline relies on multiple large models (VLMs, LLMs) and was evaluated using GPT-4, which introduces potential issues of cost, reproducibility, and inherited biases.\n    *   The data factory uses a VLM for scene description and an LLM-based agent for summarization into BDDL format (Section 4.1, Appendix A.1). The specific models used are not named, reducing transparency.\n    *   The evaluation of task diversity and scene aesthetics relies on a GPT-4 based evaluator (Section 5.2.1, Table 6, Table 7). This makes the evaluation dependent on a proprietary, black-box model whose behavior may change over time.\n    *   The paper does not discuss the potential for the data generation process to inherit biases from these powerful \"teacher\" models, which could in turn be passed on to the EmboBrain agent.4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Clarify and Unify Main Performance Claims:**\n    *   Reconcile the conflicting 9.5% and 14.2% performance claims across the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion to present a single, consistent summary of the main result.\n    *   Provide a clear and explicit calculation in the main text for how the summary performance gain over the baseline was derived from the data in Table 1.\n    *   Perform a thorough proofread of all quantitative claims to ensure they are consistent and directly supported by the evidence presented in tables and figures.*   **Acknowledge and Discuss Sim-to-Real Transfer:**\n    *   In the conclusion or a new limitations section, explicitly discuss the sim-to-real gap as a key challenge for future work.\n    *   Elaborate on which design choices in EmboMatrix might facilitate transfer (e.g., diverse, physically plausible scenes) and which might impede it (e.g., the pre-cached physics interface).\n    *   Suggest concrete research directions for adapting the EmboMatrix framework for real-world deployment, such as incorporating domain randomization or fine-tuning with a small amount of real-world data.*   **Improve Clarity of Experimental Setup in Main Text:**\n    *   In Section 5.1, please add a sentence specifying the approximate size of the training dataset (e.g., \"we generated and trained on approximately X tasks across Y scenes\").\n    *   In Section 4.3, briefly summarize the key reward values or scaling principles from Appendix C to give the reader a better sense of the reward structure.\n    *   In Section 4, when describing the agent's action sequence generation, provide a brief, high-level summary of the available action primitives, referencing Table 8 for the full list.\n    *   Correct the figure reference in Section 5.2.1 to point to Figure 6 for the visual comparison of scene generation quality.\n    *   Clarify the identity of the \"GPT-o1-mini\" model in Table 1 or correct it if it is a typographical error.*   **Analyze and Mitigate Reliance on External Models:**\n    *   For transparency, please explicitly name the specific VLM and LLM versions used in the data factory pipeline (Section 4.1).\n    *   Add a brief discussion regarding the potential for the data generation process to inherit biases from the foundation models it employs and how this might affect the final trained agent.\n    *   Consider discussing the feasibility of replacing the proprietary models with open-source alternatives to enhance the framework's accessibility and reproducibility.5) Score\n*   Overall (10): 7 — The paper presents an impressive and comprehensive system, but the contribution is weakened by inconsistent reporting of the main quantitative results.\n*   Novelty (10): 8 — The integrated \"training ground\" concept, particularly the multi-agent data factory and the highly optimized distributed simulation backend, represents a novel and impactful approach.\n*   Technical Quality (10): 7 — The system architecture and ablations are strong (Section 5.2, 5.3), but the inconsistent and unsupported reporting of headline performance gains is a significant flaw (Abstract, Conclusion, Table 1).\n*   Clarity (10): 7 — The paper is generally well-written, but key experimental details are in the appendix, and there are several reporting errors (e.g., incorrect figure references, ambiguous baseline names in Table 1).\n*   Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, having expertise in embodied AI, reinforcement learning, and simulation systems."
