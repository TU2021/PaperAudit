Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several clear internal inconsistencies and reporting issues have been identified that materially affect the paper's scientific validity and trustworthiness.

### Summary of Findings

The manuscript presents conflicting quantitative claims regarding its primary contribution, incorrectly references key figures in the results section, and contains ambiguities in its experimental reporting. These issues undermine the confidence in the reported results and the conclusions drawn from them.

### 1. Inconsistent and Unsupported Claims of Main Performance Gain

The central claim regarding the performance improvement of EmboBrain-7B over the DeepSeek-R1 baseline is stated inconsistently across the manuscript, and the primary values cited are not supported by the data presented in Table 1.

*   **Conflicting Values:**
    *   The **Abstract (Block #2)** and **Introduction (Block #8)** claim that "EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1 baseline by **9.5%** on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks" and "by **9.5%** on average," respectively.
    *   The **Conclusion (Block #37)** states that "our EmboBrain-7B achieving a **14.2%** performance gain over a strong baseline."

*   **Contradiction with Data in Table 1 (Block #21):**
    A direct calculation based on the success rates reported in Table 1 does not support either the 9.5% or the 14.2% claim as an average or overall result.
    *   On "Our Agent-Generated Benchmark," the performance difference is 65.8% (EmboBrain-7B) - 51.6% (DeepSeek-R1) = **14.2 percentage points**.
    *   On the "Embodied Agent Interface (EAI) Benchmark," the difference is 64.3% (EmboBrain-7B) - 58.2% (DeepSeek-R1) = **6.1 percentage points**.

*   **Analysis of Discrepancy:**
    *   The **14.2%** value cited in the conclusion is not an overall gain but rather the specific percentage point difference from only one of the two benchmarks ("Our Agent-Generated Benchmark"). Presenting this single, more favorable result as the summary conclusion is misleading.
    *   The **9.5%** value from the Abstract and Introduction cannot be derived from the provided data through standard calculations (e.g., the average percentage point difference is (14.2 + 6.1) / 2 = **10.15**). This key introductory claim appears to be unsupported by the paper's own results table.

This fundamental inconsistency between the abstract, conclusion, and the experimental data table raises serious concerns about the reliability of the paper's reported contributions.

### 2. Incorrect Figure Referencing in Experimental Section

There is a persistent error in referencing figures within the experimental analysis of the data generation component, which confuses the evidence presented for one of the system's core contributions.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   In **Section 5.2.1 (Block #34)**, the text discusses the quality and aesthetics of scene generation. It states, "...as shown in **Fig. 5**" when referring to the visual quality of layouts generated by the multi-level layout tree.
    *   However, **Figure 5 (Block #27, #33)** is a line graph titled "Social simulation significantly increases the diversity of tasks."
    *   The visual evidence for scene generation quality is actually presented in **Figure 6 (Block #27)** and the associated uncaptioned images (**Blocks #30, #31, #32**).
*   **Impact:** This incorrect referencing occurs multiple times in the paragraph, making it difficult for a reader to connect the quantitative claims in Table 2 with the qualitative evidence meant to support them. This detracts from the validation of the "Multi-Agent–Driven Automated Data Factory."

### 3. Ambiguous Baseline Model in Results Table

Table 1, the central results table, lists a baseline model with an unclear and potentially erroneous name, hindering the interpretation and reproducibility of the comparisons.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Table 1 (Block #21)** includes a model named "**GPT-o1-mini**".
    *   This name does not correspond to a widely known public model. It is listed alongside "GPT-4o-mini" and "GPT-4o," suggesting it may be a typographical error.
    *   The model achieves a significantly different score (e.g., 58.6% on EAI Overall) compared to GPT-4o-mini (26.5%), indicating it is not a duplicate entry.
*   **Impact:** The lack of clarity regarding this baseline model makes it impossible to verify the comparison or understand its relevance, reducing the overall trustworthiness of the experimental evaluation.
