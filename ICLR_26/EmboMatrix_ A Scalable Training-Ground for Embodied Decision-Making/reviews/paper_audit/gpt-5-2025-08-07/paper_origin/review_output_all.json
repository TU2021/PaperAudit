  "baseline_review": "Summary\n   - The paper introduces EmboMatrix, a “training ground” for embodied decision-making that integrates three components: a multi-agent data factory for generating task–scene pairs, a scalable distributed simulation backend with semantic abstraction via a pre-cached physics interface, and a hierarchical reward architecture. EmboMatrix is used to post-train EmboBrain (1.5B and 7B) with GRPO on procedurally generated tasks based on BEHAVIOR-1K scenes. The method reports large gains on two benchmarks (an internal agent-generated test set and the Embodied Agent Interface) and presents system ablations showing >50× simulation latency reduction and algorithmic ablations demonstrating the importance of a semantic relevance reward. Qualitative examples illustrate physically consistent action sequences that succeed in simulation.Strengths\n- Bold, unified “training ground” concept and systemization\n  - The paper defines a formal training-ground operator F(Dtask, M, R) in Section 3 with Equations (1)–(3) that cleanly frames embodied decision-making optimization; this provides conceptual clarity and a reusable abstraction (novelty/clarity).\n  - Figure 2 and Figure 10 (overview) decompose the pipeline into Data Level, System Level, and Algorithm Level, tying components to the formal framework (clarity/impact).\n  - Section 4 describes each subsystem (multi-agent data factory, scalable backend, hierarchical rewards) in a cohesive loop that directly supports RL training of LLMs (technical soundness/impact).- Strong empirical gains on embodied decision-making benchmarks\n  - Table 1 shows EmboBrain-7B exceeding DeepSeek-R1 (671B) by +9.5 percentage points on average across the two embodied benchmarks, with substantial gains in Kitchen Operation (impact).\n  - Figure 1(b) highlights a +58.8 percentage-point improvement on EAI when augmenting a 7B model with EmboMatrix training, showing effectiveness even versus much larger models (experimental rigor/impact).\n  - Figure 4/Block 24 shows qualitative success on “Heat Chicken” where EmboBrain-7B produces a complete, executable sequence compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 (clarity/technical soundness).- Scalable simulation backend with substantial measured speedups\n  - Section 4.2 and Appendix B.2 detail architectural decoupling (LLM trainer vs. heterogeneous simulation workers), predictive Resource-Scheduler, and Task-Dispatcher; Figure 8 illustrates the distributed design (system novelty/technical soundness).\n  - Table 3 reports per-rollout latency reduced from 3.48s to 0.07s via pre-cached execution, scheduler, and dispatcher—over 50× improvement (experimental rigor/impact).\n  - Appendix B.1 describes semantic abstraction via outcome-based execution that achieves 5×–100× speedup for quasi-static interactions (technical soundness/impact).- Multi-agent data factory producing diverse, structured tasks and scenes\n  - Section 4.1 and Figure 3/17 show a multi-stage instruction and scene generation pipeline: role playing, social simulation, summarization to BDDL, and multi-level layout tree (novelty/clarity).\n  - Figure 5 and Table 2 demonstrate that social simulation increases task diversity (average score 8.42 vs. 4.70) and the multi-level layout tree improves aesthetics and verification pass rate (71.43% generation, 98% pass) (experimental rigor/impact).\n  - Appendix A (A.1–A.2) provides detailed agents (Scene-level Distribution, Room-level Organization, Planar-level Placement, Object-level Sampling) for interpretable and verifiable scene construction (technical soundness/clarity).- Hierarchical reward architecture improves sample efficiency\n  - Section 4.3 introduces a three-tier reward: format adherence (rf), semantic relevance (rr), and goal-oriented success (rg), explicitly targeting credit assignment in long-horizon tasks (novelty/technical soundness).\n  - Section 5.3 and Figure 7 show that adding semantic relevance markedly improves training curves, while the ablation without rr stagnates (experimental rigor/impact).\n  - Appendix C provides concrete coefficients (β=0.2 capped at 1; α=30/Nsub; parsing penalties), improving transparency of reward shaping (clarity/reproducibility).- Clear problem setup and learning algorithm specification\n  - Section 3 formalizes action sequencing over a skill library 𝒜 and objective (Equation 3), anchoring the approach to embodied RL (clarity/technical soundness).\n  - Section 4.4 specifies GRPO with group-normalized advantages and clipping, including the surrogate objective and KL regularization to πref (technical soundness/clarity).\n  - Appendix D/E list skill primitives (Table 8) and compare to prior embodied data generation (Table 4), helping contextualize scope and expressiveness (clarity/impact).Weaknesses\n- Reliance on LLM-based evaluators for diversity and aesthetics may bias data-quality assessment\n  - Section 5.2.1 uses a GPT-4-based evaluator to score task diversity and scene aesthetics (Table 2); prompts for evaluators are in Appendix F (Tables 6–7). This introduces subjective bias and model drift concerns, impacting the validity of diversity/quality claims (experimental rigor).\n  - No human evaluation or inter-rater reliability is reported to corroborate GPT-4 scoring; “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This limits robustness of the diversity and aesthetics conclusions (experimental rigor).\n  - There is no statistical calibration or significance testing presented for the evaluator scores (Section 5.2.1; Appendix F), weakening the confidence in the improvements claimed in Figure 5 and Table 2 (experimental rigor).- Lack of real-world validation and transfer analysis\n  - The paper reports only simulated results (Section 5.1; Embodied Agent Interface and an agent-generated benchmark) and does not present any hardware experiments; “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This leaves generalization to real robots uncertain (impact/technical soundness).\n  - The pre-cached physics interface (Section 4.2; Appendix B.1) explicitly bypasses continuous micro-dynamics; without real-world tests, it is unclear whether policies trained under this abstraction transfer (technical soundness/impact).\n  - No domain randomization or sim-to-real overfitting analysis is described in Section 5, limiting external validity (experimental rigor).- Potential fidelity gap introduced by outcome-based, pre-cached execution\n  - Appendix B.1 states that common interaction skills bypass continuous motion simulation by instantiating valid terminal poses from a pre-computed set; while fast, this could misrepresent dynamics for tasks where intermediate states and constraints matter (technical soundness/novelty).\n  - The paper does not quantify the semantic or physical fidelity loss compared to fully simulated execution for representative tasks; “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This risks reward misalignment (technical soundness).\n  - Interaction skills that are not quasi-static (e.g., sequences involving collisions or forces) are not analyzed for degradation under pre-cached outcomes (Section 4.2, Appendix B.1); “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” (experimental rigor).- Benchmarking fairness and reporting details are incomplete\n  - Table 1 compares EmboBrain with proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-o1-mini, GPT-oss-20b) and very large models (DeepSeek-R1/V3) without detailing whether identical prompting, action-schema, and environment interfaces were used across all models (Section 5.1). “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This can confound fairness (experimental rigor).\n  - Evaluation uses 100 task-scene pairs per benchmark and samples 10 queries per task (Section 5.1) but does not report confidence intervals, statistical tests, or variance across seeds, limiting interpretability of gains (experimental rigor).\n  - The internal benchmark is “manually verified” but generated by the same pipeline (Section 5.1), which could advantage EmboBrain due to train–test alignment; no cross-benchmark generalization beyond EAI is shown (experimental rigor/impact).- Reproducibility gaps in training and data generation specifics\n  - The number of training tasks, episodes, and rollout steps is not specified (Section 5.1); only “leverages a base set of 45 diverse scenes” is given. “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This impedes replication (reproducibility).\n  - GRPO hyperparameters (clipping ε, KL β values, batch sizes, sequence lengths) are not enumerated; Section 4.4 gives formulae but no numeric settings. “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” (reproducibility).\n  - The mapping from skill primitives (Table 8) to low-level controllers and their parameters is not provided; Section 4.2 and Appendix B.1/B.2 describe interfaces but lack executable config details. “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” (reproducibility).- Clarity and consistency issues in writing and figures/tables\n  - Table 1 appears truncated for the “7B Base” row (Block 21–23) and includes long composite columns that are hard to parse, affecting clarity (clarity).\n  - The paper cites different headline gains: Abstract claims +9.5% over DeepSeek-R1 on average, whereas Conclusion states “14.2% performance gain” (Section 6), which is inconsistent (clarity).\n  - Cross-references sometimes mismatch: Related Work mentions “Table 4” for comparison, but the comprehensive comparison table appears in Appendix (Table 4 in Appendix G), which may confuse readers (clarity).Suggestions for Improvement\n- Reduce evaluator bias and strengthen data-quality assessment\n  - Complement GPT-4-based diversity and aesthetics scoring (Section 5.2.1; Appendix F, Tables 6–7) with human evaluations and report inter-rater reliability (e.g., Cohen’s kappa) to validate trends and mitigate bias (verifiable: add a human-eval protocol and statistics).\n  - Provide ablation comparing GPT-4 scores with simple, objective proxies (e.g., entropy of action types, object/room coverage rates, initial-condition satisfaction rates) to triangulate diversity (verifiable: add metrics and plots alongside Figure 5/Table 2).\n  - Include statistical significance testing (e.g., bootstrapped CIs) for all evaluator scores to quantify uncertainty (verifiable: add CIs/p-values in Section 5.2.1 and Table 2).- Add real-world validation and transfer analysis\n  - Demonstrate EmboBrain-7B executing a subset of tasks on a physical platform or a high-fidelity robot simulator with physics preserved (e.g., running identical programs with controllers rather than instantiation) and report success rates (verifiable: add a hardware or high-fidelity sim section).\n  - Study sim-to-real transfer with domain randomization during training (textures/friction/lighting) and evaluate whether policies remain robust on perturbed simulation or real setups (verifiable: add randomized training and robustness results).\n  - Report failure cases and qualitative analyses for real or high-fidelity executions to identify gaps introduced by simulated training (verifiable: add a failure-case appendix with logs/videos).- Quantify and bound fidelity loss from pre-cached outcome execution\n  - For representative tasks, compare outcomes from pre-cached execution vs. full physics traces and measure discrepancies in intermediate states and success (verifiable: add a fidelity benchmark in Section 5.2.2 or Appendix B.1).\n  - Introduce a conservative fallback that triggers full physics when constraints depend on dynamics (e.g., tight clearances, potential collisions) and report the performance/latency trade-off (verifiable: add an ablation table analogous to Table 3).\n  - Validate that reward computation (Section 4.3; Appendix C) remains consistent under both execution modes by cross-checking predicate satisfaction and failure modes (verifiable: add predicate-level agreement statistics).- Improve benchmarking fairness and reporting\n  - Publish exact prompts, action schemas, and environment interfaces used for each compared model in Section 5.1 and Appendix F to ensure identical conditions, or clearly separate results that use different interfaces (verifiable: add prompt and interface dumps).\n  - Expand benchmarks beyond 100 tasks per set and report confidence intervals/standard deviations across seeds; include significance tests for Table 1 to support claims (verifiable: add statistics for each cell of Table 1).\n  - Add evaluations on at least one third-party benchmark (e.g., ALFRED, Habitat tasks) not produced by the pipeline to reduce train–test alignment concerns (verifiable: include new benchmark section and comparative results).- Enhance reproducibility with complete training and data generation details\n  - Report the number of generated training tasks, episodes, rollout lengths, and curriculum stages; include dataset stats per category (Pick/Place, Appliance Usage, etc.) in Section 5.1 and Appendix A (verifiable: add a dataset statistics table).\n  - Provide full GRPO hyperparameters (ε, β, batch G/B sizes, KL schedule, learning rates) and training schedules; include config files or scripts in the code release (verifiable: add a hyperparameter table in Appendix D).\n  - Document the mapping from Table 8 primitives to controllers (gain, speed, constraints) and the simulator versions/assets used, enabling end-to-end replication (verifiable: add controller specs and asset lists).- Resolve clarity and consistency issues\n  - Fix truncations and layout issues in Table 1 and ensure consistent formatting across composite columns; add per-category plots for readability (verifiable: update table and add plots).\n  - Reconcile headline performance numbers (Abstract’s +9.5% vs. Conclusion’s 14.2%) and reference the precise anchored results (Table 1;

Figure 1(b)) and convincing system/algorithm ablations (Table 3; Figure 7), but lacks real-world validation and some fairness/reproducibility details (Section 5.1; Appendix F).\n  - Novelty (10): 7 — The unified concept and concrete instantiation of a scalable training ground with multi-agent data, distributed simulation, and hierarchical rewards are distinctive (Section 4; Figure 2; Appendix B), though related ideas exist in embodied RL and simulators (Section 2; Table 4 in Appendix).\n  - Technical Quality (10): 6 — Strong system engineering and ablations (Table 3; Figure 7), yet evaluator bias (Section 5.2.1; Appendix F), potential fidelity gaps (Appendix B.1), and limited statistical reporting (Section 5.1) reduce rigor.\n  - Clarity (10): 6 — Clear formalization and pipeline figures (Section 3; Figure 2; Figure 8), but table truncations, inconsistent headline numbers (+9.5% vs. 14.2%), and cross-reference issues detract (Table 1; Section 6; Appendix).\n  - Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence in reading and assessing technical content due to detailed method/appendices (Sections 4; Appendix A–C), but lower confidence in external validity because real-world results and some evaluation details are missing (No direct evidence found in the manuscript).",

This introduces subjective bias and model drift concerns, impacting the validity of diversity/quality claims (experimental rigor).\n  - No human evaluation or inter-rater reliability is reported to corroborate GPT-4 scoring; “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This limits robustness of the diversity and aesthetics conclusions (experimental rigor).\n  - There is no statistical calibration or significance testing presented for the evaluator scores (Section 5.2.1;

Section 5.1; Table 3; Figure 7), but internal inconsistencies and missing details (Table 1 truncation; Abstract vs Section 5.1 vs Conclusion; Appendix B.2/Figure 8 vs Appendix A.1–A.2) materially affect trustworthiness.\n  - Novelty (10): 7 — A unified training ground combining multi-agent data generation, distributed simulation, and hierarchical rewards is well-articulated (Section 4; Figure 2; Appendix B), though many components build on established paradigms (Related Work; Table 4).\n  - Technical Quality (10): 5 — Solid engineering and ablations (Table 3; Figure 7), but evaluator bias (Section 5.2.1; Appendix F), fidelity concerns (Appendix B.1), missing EmboBrain-7B numerical row and inconsistent metrics (Table 1; Abstract/Section 5.1/Section 6), and simulator integration gaps (Appendix B.2; Figure 8; Appendix A.1–A.2) reduce rigor.\n  - Clarity (10): 5 — Clear formalization and pipeline figures (Section 3; Figure 2; Figure 8) but table truncations, conflicting headline numbers (“9.5%,” “60.3%/58.8%,” “14.2%”), unreconciled qualitative vs quantitative scores (Figure 4; Appendix C), and reporting mismatches (Section 5.2.1; Table 2; Table 3) detract.\n  - Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence in the system description and ablations (Sections 4; Appendix B; Figure 7), with reduced confidence in external validity and some results due to missing EmboBrain-7B metrics in Table 1 and simulator usage inconsistencies (Section 5.1; Table 1; Appendix B.2/Figure 8 vs Appendix A).",

  "reviews": "Summary\n   - The paper introduces EmboMatrix, a training ground for embodied decision-making integrating: a multi-agent data factory that generates task–scene pairs from BEHAVIOR-1K/OmniGibson scenes, a scalable distributed simulation backend with semantic abstraction via a pre-cached physics interface, and a hierarchical reward architecture. EmboMatrix is used to post-train EmboBrain (1.5B and 7B) with GRPO on procedurally generated tasks. Reported results include improvements on two benchmarks (an internal agent-generated test set and EAI), ablations showing approximately 50× simulation latency reduction, and algorithmic ablations highlighting the importance of a semantic relevance reward. Qualitative examples illustrate physically consistent sequences that succeed in simulation.Strengths\n- Bold, unified “training ground” concept and systemization\n  - The paper defines a formal training-ground operator F(Dtask, M, R) in Section 3 with Equations (1)–(3) that cleanly frames embodied decision-making optimization; this provides conceptual clarity and a reusable abstraction (novelty/clarity).\n  - Figure 2 and Figure 10 (overview) decompose the pipeline into Data Level, System Level, and Algorithm Level, tying components to the formal framework (clarity/impact).\n  - Section 4 describes each subsystem (multi-agent data factory, scalable backend, hierarchical rewards) in a cohesive loop that directly supports RL training of LLMs (technical soundness/impact).\n- Strong empirical gains on embodied decision-making benchmarks\n  - Figure 1(b) shows a +58.8 percentage-point improvement on EAI when augmenting a 7B model with EmboMatrix training, indicating effectiveness even versus much larger models (Section: Introduction; Figure 1(b)) (experimental rigor/impact).\n  - Section 5.1 reports substantial EmboMatrix gains for the 7B model (“60.3%” and “58.8%” improvements across two benchmarks), and the text accompanying Table 1 states EmboBrain-7B surpasses GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 by “18.2” and “14.8” percentage points on the agent-generated benchmark (Section 5.1; Table 1 caption/text) (impact).\n  - Figure 4 shows qualitative success on “Heat Chicken” where EmboBrain-7B produces a complete, executable sequence compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 (clarity/technical soundness).\n- Scalable simulation backend with substantial measured speedups\n  - Section 4.2 and Appendix B.2 detail architectural decoupling (LLM trainer vs. heterogeneous simulation workers), predictive Resource-Scheduler, and Task-Dispatcher; Figure 8 illustrates the distributed design (system novelty/technical soundness).\n  - Table 3 reports per-rollout latency reduced from 3.48s to 0.07s via pre-cached execution, scheduler, and dispatcher—about a 50× improvement (experimental rigor/impact).\n  - Appendix B.1 describes semantic abstraction via outcome-based execution that achieves 5×–100× speedup for quasi-static interactions (technical soundness/impact).\n- Multi-agent data factory producing diverse, structured tasks and scenes\n  - Section 4.1 and Figure 3/17 show a multi-stage instruction and scene generation pipeline: role playing, social simulation, summarization to BDDL, and multi-level layout tree (novelty/clarity).\n  - Figure 5 and Table 2 demonstrate that social simulation increases task diversity (average score 8.42 vs. 4.70) and the multi-level layout tree improves aesthetics and verification pass rate (71.43% generation, 98% pass) (experimental rigor/impact).\n  - Appendix A (A.1–A.2) provides detailed agents (Scene-level Distribution, Room-level Organization, Planar-level Placement, Object-level Sampling) for interpretable and verifiable scene construction (technical soundness/clarity).\n- Hierarchical reward architecture improves sample efficiency\n  - Section 4.3 introduces a three-tier reward: format adherence (rf), semantic relevance (rr), and goal-oriented success (rg), explicitly targeting credit assignment in long-horizon tasks (novelty/technical soundness).\n  - Section 5.3 and Figure 7 show that adding semantic relevance markedly improves training curves, while the ablation without rr stagnates (experimental rigor/impact).\n  - Appendix C provides concrete coefficients (β=0.2 capped at 1; α=30/Nsub; parsing penalties), improving transparency of reward shaping (clarity/reproducibility).\n- Clear problem setup and learning algorithm specification\n  - Section 3 formalizes action sequencing over a skill library 𝒜 and objective (Equation 3), anchoring the approach to embodied RL (clarity/technical soundness).\n  - Section 4.4 specifies GRPO with group-normalized advantages and clipping, including the surrogate objective and KL regularization to πref (technical soundness/clarity).\n  - Appendix D/E list skill primitives (Table 8) and compare to prior embodied data generation (Table 4), helping contextualize scope and expressiveness (clarity/impact).Weaknesses\n- Reliance on LLM-based evaluators for diversity and aesthetics may bias data-quality assessment\n  - Section 5.2.1 uses a GPT-4-based evaluator to score task diversity and scene aesthetics (Table 2); prompts for evaluators are in Appendix F (Tables 6–7). This introduces subjective bias and model drift concerns, impacting the validity of diversity/quality claims (experimental rigor).\n  - No human evaluation or inter-rater reliability is reported to corroborate GPT-4 scoring; “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This limits robustness of the diversity and aesthetics conclusions (experimental rigor).\n  - There is no statistical calibration or significance testing presented for the evaluator scores (Section 5.2.1; Appendix F), weakening the confidence in the improvements claimed in Figure 5 and Table 2 (experimental rigor).\n- Lack of real-world validation and transfer analysis\n  - The paper reports only simulated results (Section 5.1; Embodied Agent Interface and an agent-generated benchmark) and does not present any hardware experiments; “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This leaves generalization to real robots uncertain (impact/technical soundness).\n  - The pre-cached physics interface (Section 4.2; Appendix B.1) explicitly bypasses continuous micro-dynamics; without real-world tests, it is unclear whether policies trained under this abstraction transfer (technical soundness/impact).\n  - No domain randomization or sim-to-real overfitting analysis is described in Section 5, limiting external validity (experimental rigor).\n- Potential fidelity gap introduced by outcome-based, pre-cached execution\n  - Appendix B.1 states that common interaction skills bypass continuous motion simulation by instantiating valid terminal poses from a pre-computed set; while fast, this could misrepresent dynamics for tasks where intermediate states and constraints matter (technical soundness/novelty).\n  - The paper does not quantify the semantic or physical fidelity loss compared to fully simulated execution for representative tasks; “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This risks reward misalignment (technical soundness).\n  - Interaction skills that are not quasi-static (e.g., sequences involving collisions or forces) are not analyzed for degradation under pre-cached outcomes (Section 4.2, Appendix B.1); “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” (experimental rigor).\n- Benchmarking fairness and reporting details are incomplete\n  - Table 1 compares EmboBrain with proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-o1-mini, GPT-oss-20b) and very large models (DeepSeek-R1/V3) without detailing whether identical prompting, action-schema, and environment interfaces were used across all models (Section 5.1). “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This can confound fairness (experimental rigor).\n  - Evaluation uses 100 task-scene pairs per benchmark and samples 10 queries per task (Section 5.1) but does not report confidence intervals, statistical tests, or variance across seeds, limiting interpretability of gains (experimental rigor).\n  - The internal benchmark is “manually verified” but generated by the same pipeline (Section 5.1), which could advantage EmboBrain due to train–test alignment; no cross-benchmark generalization beyond EAI is shown (experimental rigor/impact).\n- Reproducibility gaps in training and data generation specifics\n  - The number of training tasks, episodes, and rollout steps is not specified (Section 5.1); only “leverages a base set of 45 diverse scenes” is given. “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” This impedes replication (reproducibility).\n  - GRPO hyperparameters (clipping ε, KL β values, batch sizes, sequence lengths) are not enumerated; Section 4.4 gives formulae but no numeric settings. “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” (reproducibility).\n  - The mapping from skill primitives (Table 8) to low-level controllers and their parameters is not provided; Section 4.2 and Appendix B.1/B.2 describe interfaces but lack executable config details. “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” (reproducibility).\n- Clarity and consistency issues in writing and figures/tables\n  - Table 1 appears truncated for the “7B Base” row (Section 5.1; Table 1) and includes long composite columns that are hard to parse, affecting clarity (clarity).\n  - The paper cites different headline gains: Abstract claims “9.5%” over DeepSeek-R1 on average (Abstract), Section 5.1 reports “60.3%” and “58.8%” improvements (Section 5.1), whereas Conclusion states “14.2% performance gain” (Section 6), and units alternate between “percent” and “percentage points,” which is inconsistent (clarity).\n  - The qualitative “score 0/0.5/1” scale in Figure 4 is not reconciled with the quantitative reward scale where total task reward is 30 and α = 30/Nsub (Appendix C; Figure 4), making it unclear how example scores map to training/evaluation metrics (clarity).\n  - Section 5.2.1 states four scene-generation metrics including “time,” but Table 2 reports only three (Generation Rate, Aesthetic Score, Verification Pass Rate), creating a reporting mismatch (Section 5.2.1; Table 2) (clarity).\n  - The efficiency caption claims “over 50×” reduction while Table 3 numbers correspond to ~49.7× (3.48s→0.07s), a minor quantitative overstatement (Table 3) (clarity).\n  - Cross-references sometimes mismatch: Related Work mentions “Table 4” for comparison, but the comprehensive comparison table appears in Appendix (Table 4 in Appendix G), which may confuse readers (clarity).\n- Simulator usage inconsistency and missing integration details\n  - Scene generation and relations repeatedly cite OmniGibson/BEHAVIOR-1K (Appendix A.1–A.2; Section 5.1), while the distributed backend figure legend labels the simulator as “Isaac Sim simulator” (Appendix B.2; Figure 8 legend), without explaining the relationship or conversion pipeline (clarity/reproducibility).\n  - No description is provided for how BEHAVIOR-1K/OmniGibson scenes are executed under Isaac Sim or whether both simulators are used; “No direct evidence found in the manuscript.” (reproducibility).\n  - The lack of a compatibility layer or dataset conversion details introduces uncertainty about environment parity across components (Appendix A vs. Appendix B.2; Figure 8), affecting end-to-end replication (technical soundness/reproducibility).Suggestions for Improvement\n- Reduce evaluator bias and strengthen data-quality assessment\n  - Complement GPT-4-based diversity and aesthetics scoring (Section 5.2.1; Appendix F, Tables 6–7) with human evaluations and report inter-rater reliability (e.g., Cohen’s kappa) to validate trends and mitigate bias (verifiable: add a human-eval protocol and statistics).\n  - Provide ablation comparing GPT-4 scores with simple, objective proxies (e.g., entropy of action types, object/room coverage rates, initial-condition satisfaction rates) to triangulate diversity (verifiable: add metrics and plots alongside Figure 5/Table 2).\n  - Include statistical significance testing (e.g., bootstrapped CIs) for all evaluator scores to quantify uncertainty (verifiable: add CIs/p-values in Section 5.2.1 and Table 2).\n- Add real-world validation and transfer analysis\n  - Demonstrate EmboBrain-7B executing a subset of tasks on a physical platform or a high-fidelity robot simulator with physics preserved (e.g., running identical programs with controllers rather than instantiation) and report success rates (verifiable: add a hardware or high-fidelity sim section).\n  - Study sim-to-real transfer with domain randomization during training (textures/friction/lighting) and evaluate whether policies remain robust on perturbed simulation or real setups (verifiable: add randomized training and robustness results).\n  - Report failure cases and qualitative analyses for real or high-fidelity executions to identify gaps introduced by simulated training (verifiable: add a failure-case appendix with logs/videos).\n- Quantify and bound fidelity loss from pre-cached outcome execution\n  - For representative tasks, compare outcomes from pre-cached execution vs. full physics traces and measure discrepancies in intermediate states and success (verifiable: add a fidelity benchmark in Section 5.2.2 or Appendix B.1).\n  - Introduce a conservative fallback that triggers full physics when constraints depend on dynamics (e.g., tight clearances, potential collisions) and report the performance/latency trade-off (verifiable: add an ablation table analogous to Table 3).\n  - Validate that reward computation (Section 4.3; Appendix C) remains consistent under both execution modes by cross-checking predicate satisfaction and failure modes (verifiable: add predicate-level agreement statistics).\n- Improve benchmarking fairness and reporting\n  - Publish exact prompts, action schemas, and environment interfaces used for each compared model in Section 5.1 and Appendix F to ensure identical conditions, or clearly separate results that use different interfaces (verifiable: add prompt and interface dumps).\n  - Expand benchmarks beyond 100 tasks per set and report confidence intervals/standard deviations across seeds; include significance tests for Table 1 to support claims (verifiable: add statistics for each cell of Table 1).\n  - Add evaluations on at least one third-party benchmark (e.g., ALFRED, Habitat tasks) not produced by the pipeline to reduce train–test alignment concerns (verifiable: include new benchmark section and comparative results).\n- Enhance reproducibility with complete training and data generation details\n  - Report the number of generated training tasks, episodes, rollout lengths, and curriculum stages; include dataset stats per category (Pick/Place, Appliance Usage, etc.) in Section 5.1 and Appendix A (verifiable: add a dataset statistics table).\n  - Provide full GRPO hyperparameters (ε, β, batch G/B sizes, KL schedule, learning rates) and training schedules; include config files or scripts in the code release (verifiable: add a hyperparameter table in Appendix D).\n  - Document the mapping from Table 8 primitives to controllers (gain, speed, constraints) and the simulator versions/assets used, enabling end-to-end replication (verifiable: add controller specs and asset lists).\n- Resolve clarity and consistency issues\n  - Fix truncations and layout issues in Table 1 and ensure consistent formatting across composite columns; add per-category plots for readability (verifiable: update table and add plots).\n  - Reconcile headline performance numbers (Abstract’s “9.5%” vs. Section 5.1’s “60.3%/58.8%” vs. Conclusion’s “14.2%”) and reference the precise anchored results (Figure 1(b); Table 1) to avoid confusion; standardize “percent” vs “percentage points” (verifiable: edit Abstract, Section 5.1, and Section 6 for consistency).\n  - Define the mapping between qualitative “score” examples (Figure 4) and quantitative rewards (Appendix C) so readers can relate example outcomes to training metrics (verifiable: add a short subsection/figure note).\n  - Include the “time” metric promised in Section 5.2.1 within Table 2 or correct the setup description (verifiable: update Table 2 or text).\n  - Align efficiency claims with presented numbers (e.g., describe as “~50×” based on Table 3) to avoid overstatements (verifiable: adjust Table 3 caption/text).\n  - Ensure cross-references and numbering consistently point to the correct main-text vs appendix artifacts (verifiable: editorial pass).\n- Clarify simulator usage and integration details\n  - Explicitly state whether OmniGibson/BEHAVIOR-1K or Isaac Sim is used for training/evaluation, and where each component fits (Appendix A.1–A.2; Appendix B.2; Figure 8) (verifiable: add a simulator usage summary).\n  - If both simulators are employed, document the conversion pipeline and compatibility layer (asset formats, physics parameters, predicate checks) used to move scenes/tasks across environments (verifiable: add a systems integration appendix).\n  - Update figure legends and text to use consistent simulator nomenclature and add a brief note explaining environment parity to reduce confusion (verifiable: revise Figure 8 legend and Section 4.2 text).Score\n  - Overall (10): 6 — Strong integrated system and promising gains (Figure 1(b); Section 5.1; Table 3; Figure 7), but internal inconsistencies and missing details (Table 1 truncation; Abstract vs Section 5.1 vs Conclusion; Appendix B.2/Figure 8 vs Appendix A.1–A.2) materially affect trustworthiness.\n  - Novelty (10): 7 — A unified training ground combining multi-agent data generation, distributed simulation, and hierarchical rewards is well-articulated (Section 4; Figure 2; Appendix B), though many components build on established paradigms (Related Work; Table 4).\n  - Technical Quality (10): 5 — Solid engineering and ablations (Table 3; Figure 7), but evaluator bias (Section 5.2.1; Appendix F), fidelity concerns (Appendix B.1), missing EmboBrain-7B numerical row and inconsistent metrics (Table 1; Abstract/Section 5.1/Section 6), and simulator integration gaps (Appendix B.2; Figure 8; Appendix A.1–A.2) reduce rigor.\n  - Clarity (10): 5 — Clear formalization and pipeline figures (Section 3; Figure 2; Figure 8) but table truncations, conflicting headline numbers (“9.5%,” “60.3%/58.8%,” “14.2%”), unreconciled qualitative vs quantitative scores (Figure 4; Appendix C), and reporting mismatches (Section 5.2.1; Table 2; Table 3) detract.\n  - Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence in the system description and ablations (Sections 4; Appendix B; Figure 7), with reduced confidence in external validity and some results due to missing EmboBrain-7B metrics in Table 1 and simulator usage inconsistencies (Section 5.1; Table 1; Appendix B.2/Figure 8 vs Appendix A)."
