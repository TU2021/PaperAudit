Summary
The paper proposes EmboMatrix, a “training ground” for embodied decision-making that combines (1) a multi-agent automated data factory for generating task instructions and scenes, (2) a scalable, distributed simulation backend with semantic abstraction via a pre-cached language–physics interface, and (3) a hierarchical reward architecture. Using GRPO post-training within EmboMatrix, the authors train EmboBrain-1.5B/7B and report large gains on two embodied decision-making benchmarks, including surpassing DeepSeek-R1, with ablations on data diversity, simulation latency, and reward shaping.

Soundness
The overall formulation (Eq. 1–3) is standard and consistent, and the system components are plausibly integrated: scene/task generation (Sec. 4.1), scalable simulation (Sec. 4.2; Appendix B), reward architecture (Sec. 4.3; Appendix C), and GRPO training (Sec. 4.4). The pre-cached language–physics interface (Appendix B.1) is logically justified as an outcome-based acceleration; the authors claim preservation of “semantic consequences,” which should hold for quasi-static interactions but may partially compromise fine-grained physical fidelity. The hierarchical reward design r = r_f + r_r + r_g (Sec. 4.3) is technically coherent, and the semantic relevance term r_r is a reasonable dense proxy that addresses credit assignment. Experimental methodology is broadly sound—held-out test sets, multiple samplings per task, and ablations (Sec. 5.1–5.3)—but several key details are under-specified (e.g., total number of training tasks/episodes, GRPO hyperparameters), and some claims appear inconsistent across sections (e.g., 9.5% vs. 14.2% vs. +58.8 percentage points; Abstract, Fig. 1(b), Sec. 6). Baseline fairness is mostly addressed by unified prompts and skill libraries (Sec. 5.1), yet external LLMs may be disadvantaged without tailored format tuning.

Presentation
The paper is generally clear and well-structured, with schematic figures for the pipeline (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) and architecture (Fig. 8). Visual examples help (Fig. 4, Fig. 6, Fig. 9–10), and ablation tables highlight concrete improvements (Tab. 2, Tab. 3). However, Table 1 appears truncated in the provided excerpt, obscuring EmboBrain-7B rows; numerical claims across Abstract/Intro/Conclusion lack a single, consistent summary. Some mermaid diagrams are mixed with text (Sec. 4 and Appendix), which may hinder readability. Hyperparameter and dataset-scale details are sparse, and human evaluation is replaced by GPT-4 evaluators (Tab. 6–7), which should be clearly flagged as potential sources of bias.

Contribution
The paper’s main contribution is an end-to-end, scalable infrastructure that unifies task/scene generation, accelerated simulation, and hierarchical rewards for training LLM-based high-level embodied decision-making. While each component has antecedents (e.g., procedural generation, distributed simulation, reward shaping), the combination and practical scale are novel and valuable for the community. The empirical improvements over strong baselines and efficiency gains (50× latency reduction; Tab. 3) substantiate the significance. The “first training ground” claim is ambitious; Table 4 positions EmboMatrix against prior systems, but the field has adjacent efforts on generative simulators and RL post-training—clarifying uniqueness would strengthen the claim.

Strengths
- Cohesive system integration with clear interfaces across data, system, and algorithm levels (Sec. 4.1–4.3; Fig. 2).
- Practical acceleration via pre-cached outcome-based simulation and distributed scheduling/dispatch (Sec. 4.2; Tab. 3; Appendix B).
- Hierarchical rewards that demonstrably improve learning curves and final performance (Sec. 5.3; Fig. 7).
- Strong empirical improvements versus large baselines, including qualitative evidence of physical correctness (Sec. 5.1; Fig. 4).
- Interpretable multi-level scene generation with measurable gains in generation rate and verification pass rate (Sec. 5.2.1; Tab. 2; Fig. 6).

Weaknesses
- Numerical inconsistencies across sections (Abstract: +9.5%; Intro Fig. 1(b): +58.8 p.p.; Conclusion: +14.2%; and Table 1 excerpt missing EmboBrain-7B row), which complicate result interpretation.
- Limited disclosure of training scale and hyperparameters (e.g., GRPO ε, KL β beyond conceptual mention; Sec. 4.4) and total episodes/tasks, impacting reproducibility.
- Reliance on GPT-4 evaluators for diversity/aesthetics (Sec. 5.2.1; Tab. 6–7) introduces potential bias; human validation or inter-rater reliability is not reported.
- Pre-cached physics may reduce fine-grained fidelity or enable reward hacking if preconditions are imperfectly enforced; more fidelity checks would help (Appendix B.1).
- Baseline fairness risks: proprietary models may not adhere to formatting or skill schemas optimally despite prompt instructions (Sec. 5.1), possibly depressing their scores.

Questions
1. What is the exact size of the procedurally generated training corpus (number of tasks, episodes, total rollouts), and how does performance scale with data volume (Sec. 5.1)?
2. Which GRPO hyperparameters were used (ε, KL β, group size G, batch size B, learning rate, steps), and how sensitive are results to them (Sec. 4.4)?
3. How often does the pre-cached interface deviate from full physics? Can you quantify task success differences under full simulation vs. pre-cached outcomes (Appendix B.1)?
4. How is baseline prompt adherence enforced for proprietary models? Did you calibrate formatting penalties r_f per model to ensure fair comparisons (Sec. 4.3; Sec. 5.1)?
5. Can you provide human evaluation of task diversity/aesthetics to complement GPT-4 scorers, and report inter-rater agreement (Sec. 5.2.1; Tab. 6–7)?
6. Do results hold on additional public embodied benchmarks (e.g., VirtualHome, ALFRED) to assess generalization beyond BEHAVIOR/EAI?
7. What are the main failure modes of EmboBrain (e.g., object misidentification, sequence omissions)? Any qualitative aggregation beyond Fig. 4?

Rating
- Overall (10): 8 — Strong integrated system with demonstrated gains and efficiency, but numerical inconsistencies and reproducibility gaps remain (Sec. 5.1; Fig. 1(b); Sec. 6; Tab. 3).
- Novelty (10): 7 — The unified “training ground” is a solid systems contribution; individual components have precedents, but integration at scale is distinctive (Sec. 4; Tab. 4).
- Technical Quality (10): 8 — Methodology is coherent with convincing ablations (Sec. 5.2–5.3; Tab. 2–3; Fig. 7), though more fidelity and fairness checks are needed (Appendix B.1; Sec. 5.1).
- Clarity (10): 7 — Clear pipeline figures and component descriptions (Fig. 2–3), but inconsistent reported numbers and a truncated Table 1 hinder readability (Abstract; Fig. 1(b); Sec. 5.1).
- Confidence (5): 4 — High-level systems review based on detailed manuscript anchors, but missing full Table 1 row and absent hyperparameters limit full verification.


Summary
The paper introduces EmboMatrix, an infrastructure to post-train LLMs for embodied decision-making. It comprises a multi-agent social simulation and multi-level layout tree for task/scene generation (Sec. 4.1), a scalable simulation backend with pre-cached semantics and distributed scheduling (Sec. 4.2), and a hierarchical reward architecture with format adherence, semantic relevance, and goal completion (Sec. 4.3). GRPO (Sec. 4.4) is used for optimization. EmboBrain-7B reportedly outperforms larger baselines on EAI and an internal benchmark, with ablations on task diversity, aesthetics, latency, and reward shaping.

Soundness
The reward architecture addresses credit assignment via dense intermediate guidance (r_r), which the learning curves substantiate (Sec. 5.3; Fig. 7). The formalization of r_r (intersection of goal objects and interacted objects) is simple and effective, though it risks incentivizing spurious touches rather than meaningful progress—mitigated by r_g (Sec. 4.3) and formatting rewards r_f. GRPO is a reasonable choice for LLM policies, and the group-normalized advantage (Sec. 4.4) is well-defined. System decoupling and pre-cache mechanisms are technically credible but could alter transition dynamics; still, outcome-based acceleration appears justified for quasi-static interactions (Appendix B.1). The evaluations on two benchmarks with multi-sampling (Sec. 5.1) are appropriate, though precise counts and variance reporting are limited.

Presentation
Exposition of the three-tier reward and its coefficients is clear (Appendix C; Sec. 4.3). Pipeline and data factory figures (Fig. 2–3) aid understanding, and qualitative comparison (Fig. 4) is illustrative. However, result reporting is inconsistent across sections (Abstract vs. Fig. 1 vs. Sec. 6), and Table 1 seems incomplete in the excerpt, reducing transparency. Some diagrams are presented as mermaid code, which detracts from polish.

Contribution
This work’s key novelty lies in the combined design: multi-agent social simulation for task instructions, interpretable multi-level layout for physically valid scenes, a pre-cached physics interface to scale rollouts, and hierarchical rewards tuned for embodied reasoning. The holistic training ground is impactful and addresses a recognized gap—interactive learning for LLM-based embodied agents at scale. Empirical gains against very large models increase practical relevance.

Strengths
- Well-motivated hierarchical rewards with empirical support (Sec. 5.3; Fig. 7).
- Interpretable, verifiable scene generation with improved success and aesthetics (Sec. 5.2.1; Tab. 2; Fig. 6).
- Scalable system design achieving 50× latency reduction (Sec. 5.2.2; Tab. 3).
- Clear qualitative evidence of physically necessary steps (Fig. 4).

Weaknesses
- r_r may reward unnecessary manipulations of goal-related objects; a curriculum or predicate-level shaping beyond object intersection may be needed (Sec. 4.3).
- Inconsistent headline numbers and lack of variance/confidence intervals (Abstract; Fig. 1(b); Sec. 6; Sec. 5.1).
- Training scale and GRPO hyperparameters are not fully reported, limiting reproducibility (Sec. 4.4; Sec. 5.1).
- External evaluator reliance (GPT-4) for task diversity/aesthetics can bias conclusions (Sec. 5.2.1; Tab. 6–7).

Questions
1. Can r_r be extended to predicate-level alignment (e.g., rewarding “inside/microwave” attempts) rather than object set intersections (Sec. 4.3)?
2. What is the effect of removing r_f or annealing its weight over time—does syntax lock-in hinder exploration?
3. How many total training tasks/episodes were used, and what is the learning curve variance across seeds (Sec. 5.1)?
4. Did you test reward robustness against noisy object detection or mislabeling, which may occur in real robots?
5. How does the pre-cached interface handle actions with dynamic outcomes (e.g., pouring, pushing)? Any fallback to full physics?

Rating
- Overall (10): 7 — Reward architecture plus scalable training ground deliver solid gains, but reporting inconsistencies and limited reproducibility weaken the case (Sec. 5.1; Fig. 1(b); Sec. 6).
- Novelty (10): 8 — The integrated design of task/scene generation, scalable simulation, and hierarchical rewards is a meaningful advance (Sec. 4.1–4.3; Tab. 4).
- Technical Quality (10): 7 — Sound methods with useful ablations (Fig. 7; Tab. 2–3), yet r_r’s potential loopholes and missing hyperparameters deserve deeper analysis (Sec. 4.3–4.4).
- Clarity (10): 8 — Generally clear architecture and rewards, but mixed diagram formats and inconsistent numerical summaries detract (Fig. 2–3; Abstract vs. Sec. 6).
- Confidence (5): 4 — Good understanding of methodology from anchors, but absent full Table 1 and limited hyperparameter detail constrain verification.


Summary
EmboMatrix is presented as a comprehensive training ground for embodied decision-making with three pillars: (i) a multi-agent social simulation to produce diverse, scene-faithful instructions and a multi-level layout tree to generate executable scenes (Sec. 4.1; Fig. 3, Fig. 6), (ii) a scalable backend using a pre-cached language–physics interface and a distributed resource scheduler/dispatcher (Sec. 4.2; Appendix B; Tab. 3), and (iii) a hierarchical reward architecture to guide LLM policies from syntax to semantics to goal success (Sec. 4.3). With GRPO post-training (Sec. 4.4), EmboBrain-7B achieves reported gains over large baselines on two benchmarks (Sec. 5.1).

Soundness
The data factory combines role-playing social agents and BDDL summarization to tie tasks to explicit goal predicates (Sec. 4.1), which is methodologically sound for grounding. The multi-level layout tree and planar constraints increase plausibility and interaction feasibility; quantitative improvements are shown (Tab. 2). The scalable system and reward architecture are coherent and supported by ablations (Tab. 3; Fig. 7). The main methodological risks are: bias in task diversity/aesthetic scoring via GPT-4 evaluators (Sec. 5.2.1) and potential mismatch between pre-cached outcomes and real physics (Appendix B.1), which could inflate success rates in simulation. Nonetheless, the paper checks feasibility with a validation agent and reports verification pass rates (Sec. 4.1; Sec. 5.2.1), partially mitigating concerns.

Presentation
The description of the data pipeline is detailed and visualized (Fig. 3; Fig. 6), aiding reproducibility at the scene-generation level. The simulation architecture is clearly diagrammed (Fig. 8) with roles for scheduler and dispatcher. However, result reporting is inconsistent across sections (9.5% vs. 14.2% vs. +58.8 p.p.; Abstract, Fig. 1(b), Sec. 6) and Table 1 appears incomplete in the provided text, which reduces transparency. Some diagrams are embedded as code blocks, and several exact training details (task counts, rollout numbers, hyperparameters) are missing.

Contribution
The work’s contribution is a practical, scalable pipeline to move LLMs from text-only to embodied interaction using procedural tasks and physically grounded rewards. The emphasis on multi-agent social simulation and interpretable layout trees is a noteworthy addition to embodied data generation. The combined system offers a path to train mid-sized LLMs that outperform very large baselines on embodied planning tasks, which is valuable for cost-effective research and deployment.

Strengths
- Interpretable and verifiable scene generation with better success, aesthetics, and pass rates (Tab. 2; Fig. 6).
- Scalable simulation with aggressive latency reductions via pre-caching and scheduling (Sec. 5.2.2; Tab. 3).
- Clean hierarchical reward design with clear curriculum effect (Sec. 5.3; Fig. 7).
- Demonstrated qualitative competence on long-horizon tasks (Fig. 4).

Weaknesses
- Heavy reliance on GPT-4 evaluators for diversity and aesthetics may bias measurements; no human inter-rater validation (Sec. 5.2.1; Tab. 6–7).
- Pre-cached physics may not capture dynamic interactions; fidelity and generalization beyond quasi-static actions are unclear (Appendix B.1).
- Reporting inconsistencies and incomplete tables make it hard to reconcile exact gains (Abstract; Fig. 1(b); Sec. 6; Table 1 excerpt).
- Reproducibility gaps: missing counts of training tasks/episodes and GRPO hyperparameters (Sec. 4.4; Sec. 5.1).

Questions
1. What is the total number of unique tasks and episodes used for training, and how are they distributed across the four categories (Sec. 5.1)?
2. Can you report human evaluation of task diversity and scene aesthetics, with inter-rater agreement, to complement GPT-4 scores (Sec. 5.2.1)?
3. How does EmboBrain perform when the pre-cached interface is disabled and full physics is used? Please provide an A/B test (Appendix B.1).
4. Are there specific dynamic tasks (e.g., pouring, pushing) where pre-caching is insufficient? How are these handled?
5. Please reconcile the different performance numbers and provide a consolidated summary with confidence intervals across benchmarks.

Rating
- Overall (10): 7 — A useful integrated framework with strong engineering and credible gains, but reporting inconsistencies and evaluator bias temper confidence (Sec. 5.1; Fig. 1(b); Tab. 2–3).
- Novelty (10): 7 — The integration of social simulation, interpretable scene generation, and scalable training is a meaningful systems contribution (Sec. 4.1–4.3; Tab. 4).
- Technical Quality (10): 7 — Sound methods with ablations; needs stronger fidelity tests and human evaluation to validate claims (Sec. 5.2–5.3; Appendix B).
- Clarity (10): 7 — Generally clear pipeline/architecture; inconsistent numbers and incomplete table reduce clarity (Fig. 2–3; Table 1 excerpt; Sec. 6).
- Confidence (5): 4 — Confident about systems/design from anchors; less confident about exact reported gains due to missing details and inconsistencies.


Summary
The manuscript presents EmboMatrix, a comprehensive training ground for embodied decision-making that procedurally generates tasks/scenes (multi-agent social simulation; layout tree), accelerates simulation via a pre-cached language–physics interface in a distributed cluster, and shapes learning with a hierarchical reward architecture. EmboBrain-7B trained with GRPO is shown to outperform very large LLMs on two benchmarks, with ablations on data diversity/quality, rollout latency, and reward shaping.

Soundness
Conceptually, the approach is sensible: generate diverse solvable tasks with explicit predicates (BDDL), ensure executable scenes via multi-level constraints, scale rollouts with semantic abstraction and decoupled infrastructure, and provide a reward curriculum. The formalization and GRPO objective (Sec. 4.4) are correct. The main scientific caveats are (i) the fidelity trade-off from outcome-based simulation (Appendix B.1), (ii) the use of GPT-4 evaluators as proxies for diversity and aesthetics (Sec. 5.2.1), and (iii) unclear training scale and hyperparameters affecting reproducibility. The empirical example (Heat Chicken; Fig. 4) validates physical reasoning steps that text-only baselines miss.

Presentation
The pipeline and architecture are well-illustrated (Fig. 2–3; Fig. 8). Ablations are clear (Tab. 2; Tab. 3; Fig. 7). However, the manuscript’s headline results are not consistently reported across sections, and the provided Table 1 is truncated, preventing verification of exact EmboBrain-7B numbers. Some content appears as code blocks, and several key experimental settings are missing, which complicates replication.

Contribution
The contribution is primarily a systems/engineering advance: a scalable, integrated training ground that operationalizes embodied post-training for LLMs. This addresses a pressing gap—moving beyond static, non-interactive fine-tuning—by combining data generation, simulation acceleration, and structured rewards. The practical performance improvements against very large LLMs, if consistent, are impactful.

Strengths
- Comprehensive, end-to-end system that materially reduces simulation latency and enables large-scale RL (Sec. 4.2; Tab. 3).
- Interpretable scene generation with quantifiable improvements (Sec. 5.2.1; Tab. 2).
- Hierarchical rewards yield better sample efficiency and final rewards (Sec. 5.3; Fig. 7).
- Clear qualitative evidence of embodied sequencing (Fig. 4).

Weaknesses
- Inconsistent top-line performance statements and incomplete Table 1 in the excerpt hinder verification (Abstract; Fig. 1(b); Sec. 6).
- Reliance on GPT-4 evaluators; human studies or standardized diversity metrics would be stronger (Sec. 5.2.1).
- Limited details on GRPO hyperparameters and training scale; reproducibility suffers (Sec. 4.4; Sec. 5.1).
- Potential fidelity gap from pre-cached outcome instantiation, especially for dynamic interactions (Appendix B.1).

Questions
1. Please provide a consolidated results table with consistent numbers across benchmarks, including confidence intervals and seeds (Sec. 5.1).
2. What are the GRPO and optimizer hyperparameters and total steps/episodes? Any tuning ablation (Sec. 4.4)?
3. How do the results change without the pre-cached interface? Provide an ablation separating speed from accuracy (Appendix B.1).
4. Can you quantify diversity using non-LLM metrics (e.g., entropy over predicates, object categories, room distributions) and compare to ProcTHOR/BEHAVIOR (Sec. 5.2.1)?
5. What measures prevent reward hacking when outcome-based simulation bypasses micro-dynamics? Are preconditions exhaustively checked?

Rating
- Overall (10): 6 — A promising and well-engineered system with strong qualitative and ablation evidence; verification issues and missing details lower the score (Sec. 5.1; Tab. 3; Fig. 4).
- Novelty (10): 7 — The integrated “training ground” approach is valuable; individual elements have precedents, but the cohesive scale is new (Sec. 4.1–4.3; Tab. 4).
- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Solid design and ablations; requires stronger statistical reporting and fidelity validation (Sec. 5.1–5.3; Appendix B).
- Clarity (10): 6 — Good figures but inconsistent numbers and missing table rows reduce clarity (Fig. 1(b); Table 1 excerpt; Sec. 6).
- Confidence (5): 4 — Reasonable confidence from detailed anchors; lack of complete numeric tables and hyperparameters prevents full verification.
