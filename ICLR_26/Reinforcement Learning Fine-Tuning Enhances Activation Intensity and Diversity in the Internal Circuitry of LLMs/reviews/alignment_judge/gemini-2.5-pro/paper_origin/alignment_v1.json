          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contribution: providing mechanistic insight into RL fine-tuning by showing increased activation intensity and diversity. They also highlight overlapping strengths, including the comprehensive experimental design, clear communication, and reproducibility.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the limited domain (math tasks only) and the lack of causal evidence as major weaknesses, though they frame the causality issue differently (Review A suggests interventions, Review B points to attribution target mismatch). However, Review B adds several technical critiques (lack of statistical rigor, normalization) not in A, while A notes a lack of connection to RL theory, which is absent in B.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment in their overall judgment, agreeing on the paper's main strengths and two of its most significant weaknesses, leading to a similar assessment of the work's value. The primary divergence is in the specific secondary weaknesses they prioritize, with Review A focusing on conceptual gaps and Review B on technical methodological flaws."

Review B, however, highlights additional specific methodological strengths, such as the unified formalization of post-training updates, which are not mentioned in Review A.",

They diverge substantially in their critical focus, with Review A offering a high-level conceptual critique while Review B provides a much more detailed and technical assessment of the methodology itself."
