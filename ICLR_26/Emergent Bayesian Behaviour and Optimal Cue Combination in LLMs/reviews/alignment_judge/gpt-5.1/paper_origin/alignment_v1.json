      "strength": "Both reviews converge strongly on the main motivations and contributions. They highlight BayesBench as a psychophysics-inspired benchmark for probing whether LLMs exhibit Bayesian-like strategies in multimodal magnitude estimation; they emphasize the introduction and importance of the Bayesian Consistency Score (BCS) as a novel metric that goes beyond accuracy; they value the controlled, ablation-heavy experimental design; they see the separation between capability (accuracy/NRMSE, efficiency) and behaviour/strategy (BCS) as a conceptual strength; and they underscore the key empirical finding that high accuracy does not imply optimal or Bayesian-consistent cue fusion, with GPT‑5 Mini as the central example. Both also frame BayesBench as a reusable framework with potential for future extensions and impact on multimodal evaluation.",
      "weakness": "There is partial but not complete overlap in weaknesses. Both reviews question whether the observed behaviour is genuinely Bayesian or might instead reflect simpler heuristics or confounds (e.g., in-context learning or steering), and both criticize the limited generality / ecological validity due to synthetic tasks and lack of richer conditions. However, the AI review goes into a different level and direction of detail: it raises several methodological and implementation-specific concerns (BCS design choices such as sign-only scoring and the 0.9 cap; potential bias in factor-evidence comparisons; lack of cue-conflict trials; temperature setting and discarding malformed outputs; appendix numerical inconsistencies; overstatements like “beyond humans”). The human review instead focuses on more conceptual limitations: confounding between accuracy and Bayesian consistency; absence of non-Bayesian control models and alternative explanations like regression to the mean; and limited diversity/realism of tasks and noise. Thus, there is meaningful overlap around: (i) doubts about claims of emergent Bayesian behaviour and need for non-Bayesian alternatives or controls, and (ii) concerns about generalizability beyond the synthetic setup. But much of the AI review’s criticism (AIC usage, BCS thresholding specifics, cue-conflict, API details, appendix errors) is not echoed in the human review, leading to only moderate alignment on weaknesses.",
      "overall": "Substantively, the two reviews are well-aligned on what the paper is about, why it is interesting, and its core positive takeaways: a novel psychophysics-inspired benchmark (BayesBench), a new BCS metric, a careful experimental setup, and the important insight that high accuracy can coexist with non-Bayesian or suboptimal fusion. On the critical side, they agree that the interpretation of Bayesian behaviour is not fully convincing and that alternative, non-Bayesian explanations or better controls are needed, and they both see limitations in the current scope and generalization of the benchmark. The AI review, however, adds a large amount of extra, more technical and implementation-level critique that the human review does not touch (statistical methodology, specific metric design parameters, reproducibility details, and appendix formatting/numerical issues). Hence, while their overall judgment and thematic focus are similar, the depth and granularity of the AI review’s methodological criticism goes well beyond the human one, resulting in strong alignment on strengths but only moderate alignment on weaknesses and an overall alignment that is good but not near-perfect."

          "weakness": "The reviews overlap on concerns about generalizability from synthetic tasks to more realistic multimodal settings and, to a degree, on the need to better validate claims of Bayesian behaviour versus simpler alternatives. However, Review A focuses on conceptual issues (potential confounding between accuracy and Bayesian evidence, lack of non-Bayesian control models, heuristic explanations like regression to the mean), while Review B concentrates on technical/reporting problems (metric inconsistencies, BCS definition and assumptions, normative baseline specification, experimental confounds, under-specified human baseline and dataset details). Thus, they share some themes but differ substantially in which weaknesses they treat as primary and in the level of detail.",
          "overall": "Substantively, both reviews portray the work as a valuable, novel benchmark that advances understanding of LLM uncertainty handling, while acknowledging important limitations, so their overall judgment and focus on the main contributions are aligned. The main divergence lies in the critique layer: Review A stresses interpretability and theoretical validity of the Bayesian claims, whereas Review B foregrounds methodological rigor, reporting issues, and experimental design details. This yields a largely consistent high-level assessment with only moderate alignment at the level of specific weaknesses and error analysis."

The human review additionally stresses future extensibility to real-world scenarios, while the AI review adds more detail on the composite scoring, model diversity, and reproducibility, but these are consistent extensions rather than shifts in emphasis.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews question whether the claimed Bayesian behaviour is genuinely Bayesian, emphasizing the need for stronger non-Bayesian baselines/controls and raising concerns that current evidence could reflect simpler heuristics or methodological bias rather than true Bayesian inference. They also converge on the limitation that the tasks are synthetic and lack explicit cue-conflict conditions, constraining identifiability of fusion weights, but the AI review adds many extra methodological critiques (BCS design choices, AIC factor evidence, temperature and malformed-output handling, appendix inconsistencies) that the human review does not mention, while the human review uniquely emphasizes broader generalizability to real-world tasks.",
          "overall": "In substance, both reviews portray the work as an innovative, valuable benchmark with a strong psychophysics grounding and an important finding about capability–strategy dissociations, but with nontrivial concerns about how firmly one can interpret the observed behaviour as Bayesian and about the current experimental scope. The AI review is much more detailed and raises several additional technical and presentation issues beyond those in the human review, so alignment is high on the central narrative and main caveats but only moderate on the full set of weaknesses and proposed refinements."
