          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the method's simplicity and efficiency, its strong empirical performance on non-IID data, and its clear conceptual motivation via a bias-variance framework. The prioritization of these points is highly consistent.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews strongly agree on the primary weaknesses, namely the unfair baseline comparisons, the lack of formal theoretical guarantees, and the limited evaluation scope (vision-only, full participation). Review B introduces an additional valid concern about the storage and privacy costs of precomputed features, which is absent in Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in substance and judgment, both concluding that the paper presents a simple, promising method whose claims are undermined by significant evaluation flaws, particularly unfair comparisons. The overall focus is nearly identical, with the main difference being a few specific critiques present in only one review."

Review B provides more granular detail and highlights specific experiments on geometry and label noise, but the main contributions are fully aligned.",
          "weakness": "There is strong overlap on the most critical weaknesses, including unfair baseline comparisons, limited theoretical depth, and the unrealistic assumption of full client participation. However, Review B is more comprehensive, adding several major critiques regarding reproducibility, unsubstantiated novelty claims, and evaluation metrics that are absent in Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, presenting the paper as a simple and empirically effective method with significant flaws in its evaluation and theory. While the core narrative is consistent, Review B provides a much more thorough and detailed critique, identifying several important weaknesses missed by Review A."

While both see the paper as empirically strong but methodologically flawed, Review B's assessment is substantially broader and more detailed in its criticism."
