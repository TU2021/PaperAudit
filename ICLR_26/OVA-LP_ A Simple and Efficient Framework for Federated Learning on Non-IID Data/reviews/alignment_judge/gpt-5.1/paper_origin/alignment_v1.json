      "strength": "Both reviews describe essentially the same core idea and contributions. They agree that OvA-LP is a minimalist FFT framework designed to suppress client drift at its source under non-IID data by: (i) freezing the encoder and using linear probing, (ii) replacing the standard softmax head with one-vs-all (OvA) binary heads, and (iii) using a two-stage training schedule (positive-only then positives + negatives). They both highlight the bias–variance decomposition as the conceptual motivation behind these design choices, emphasizing that each component targets a different source of drift (feature skew, label skew, variance). They also concur on key positives: simplicity and ease of implementation, computational and communication efficiency through precomputed features, strong empirical robustness on non-IID CIFAR-100 and related partitions, fast convergence, and good performance relative to existing FFT/PEFT methods. Review B further elaborates on robustness to label noise, multiple non-IID patterns, and efficiency metrics, but this is consistent with Review A’s broad empirical validation and claims of stability, efficiency, and generality across datasets and backbones.",
      "weakness": "The two reviews are closely aligned on the main weaknesses they identify. Both raise concerns about fairness of baseline comparisons: OvA-LP uses a frozen encoder whereas some PEFT baselines adapt the encoder; Review B adds more detail about mismatched backbones and participation ratios but this is an extension of the same fairness issue flagged in Review A. Both point out that the theoretical analysis is largely qualitative/heuristic, based on bias–variance intuitions without formal proofs or quantitative bounds, and that certain claims (e.g., elimination of label-skew drift) may be overstated. Both also note limitations in evaluation scope: primarily vision tasks with ViT encoders and largely full (100%) client participation, with only limited treatment of partial participation and other domains such as NLP or time-series/LLMs. Review A additionally asks for broader cross-domain experiments and sensitivity analysis to hyperparameters/non-IID severity, while Review B focuses more on missing implementation details (negative sampling ratios, storage/memory overhead, privacy considerations) and reproducibility. These are complementary rather than contradictory; the overlap on baseline fairness, limited theoretical depth, and constrained practical scenario (vision, full participation, strong encoders) is strong.",
      "overall": "In substance, focus, and judgment, the reviews are highly aligned. They present the same high-level picture: OvA-LP is a simple, source-level federated fine-tuning method that is empirically strong and efficient on non-IID vision benchmarks, conceptually motivated by bias–variance considerations, but with caveats around baseline comparability, lack of formal guarantees, and somewhat narrow evaluation/practical assumptions. Review B provides substantially more granular detail (multiple sub-reviews, many specific questions and references to sections/tables), and adds nuances about reproducibility, feature storage/privacy, and hyperparameter specification, while Review A emphasizes hyperparameter sensitivity and cross-domain validation. Nonetheless, there are no substantive disagreements on what the method is, why it might work, where it shines, or where the paper is less convincing. The differences are largely in depth and breadth of commentary, not in orientation, leading to a high degree of overall alignment."

          "strength": "Both reviews agree that the core motivation is source-level suppression of client drift in federated fine-tuning on non-IID data, via a minimalist, parameter-efficient design: frozen encoder, linear probing with OvA heads, and a two-stage schedule. They both highlight simplicity, efficiency, strong empirical robustness under non-IID settings, and modularity/generalizability across datasets/encoders as key strengths, with the AI review giving more detailed empirical and conceptual backing. The human review mentions generalization to NLP tasks whereas the AI review focuses more on breadth within vision and encoder scales, but this is a minor difference in emphasis.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews align on limited theoretical depth: bias–variance framing is mainly qualitative, with no formal bounds or direct measurements. They also converge on concerns about experimental scope and realism (focus on vision, strong reliance on full participation; partial participation only lightly addressed). The human review emphasizes unfair baseline comparisons due to encoder freezing vs PEFT methods, while the AI review broadens this into a more detailed fairness critique (encoder sizes, participation ratios, hyperparameters) and adds additional concerns (novelty claim, efficiency-independence claim, reproducibility details, metric choice), which are not mentioned in the human review.",
          "overall": "In substance, both reviews see the paper as a strong empirical contribution with a clear, simple design for drift suppression, but with notable caveats in theory and experimental setup/fairness. The AI review adds more granular and additional critiques (novelty, metric choices, implementation details), while the human review is more compact and omits these, yet there is no major contradiction in judgment or focus. Overall alignment is high: the core narrative about what the paper does well and where it falls short is consistent, with differences mainly in depth and breadth of secondary points."

They also agree on strong non‑IID robustness, fast convergence, efficiency, and modularity as key strengths.

          "weakness": "Both reviews flag limited theoretical rigor and fairness/comparability issues in the baselines, as well as concerns about scope/practicality (vision-centric evaluation and full participation assumptions), and they both want more systematic analysis (e.g., sensitivity, participation). The AI review raises several additional major concerns that the human review does not mention, including incomplete reproducibility of the two‑stage schedule, over‑broad novelty claims, efficiency claims not directly validated across encoder sizes, and opaque evaluation metrics. There is a mild tension where the human review credits some cross-domain/NLP experiments while the AI review frames the evaluation as largely vision-only.",
          "overall": "Substantively, both reviews portray the work as a strong, simple, and empirically effective approach whose main shortcomings lie in theory and experimental design/baseline fairness, so their overall judgment and focus are largely consistent. Alignment on motivations and main strengths is very high, while alignment on weaknesses is only moderate‑to‑high because the AI review introduces several extra critiques and methodological details not covered by the human review. Overall, the reviews are clearly analyzing the same contributions and limitations but with different depth and breadth, leading to high but not near-perfect alignment."
