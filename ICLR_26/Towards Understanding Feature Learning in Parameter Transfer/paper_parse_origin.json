However, when only a subset of parameters from the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness. To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch. Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to empirically validate our theoretical findings.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nTransfer learning has become the workhorse of modern deep learning, because it breaks the traditional curse of having to train a gigantic model from scratch for every new problem (Pan and Yang, 2009; Dai et al., 2009; Torrey and Shavlik, 2010). By reusing knowledge acquired in a source domain, practitioners can reach higher accuracy with orders-of-magnitude less labeled data and compute (Yosinski et al., 2014; Ruder et al., 2019). The dominant instantiation of this idea is the pre-train–fine-tune pipeline: an upstream model is first optimized on a large-scale, often self-supervised task and is subsequently adapted to a downstream objective (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2021; He et al., 2020). Yet the real world seldom offers a perfect one-to-one architectural match between the two stages (Zhuang et al., 2020). Upstream backbones may be deeper, include modality-specific components, or be released as black-box feature extractors (Jiang et al., 2022), while downstream tasks can impose new input resolutions, output spaces, memory budgets, or even deployment hardware that forbid a literal copy of every weight (Bommasani et al., 2021). Parameter transfer emerges as an elegant remedy to this mismatch. Because it requires no raw data from the upstream\n\n*Corresponding authors."

Such a dynamic perspective is essential, since transfer is not only about the final generalization guarantee but also about the trajectory through which knowledge is acquired and reused across tasks. Parameter transfer is intrinsically a question of network dynamics. In particular, while empirical works have repeatedly reported the phenomenon of negative transfer (Zhang et al., 2022; Zu et al., 2025), a rigorous theoretical characterization has been missing. Our work fills this gap: we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical analysis of training dynamics in parameter transfer. Importantly, our framework not only proves when and why transfer is beneficial, but also reveals, for the first time in theory, the precise conditions under which negative transfer arises. These findings significantly broaden the theoretical landscape of transfer learning and underscore the necessity of dynamic analysis for the principled design of parameter transfer.\n\nMore specifically, we aim to address two fundamental questions: (i) why parameter transfer can enhance test performance compared to random initialization, and (ii) why naive transfer learning may sometimes fail or even lead to negative transfer. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of parameter transfer within a nonlinear dynamical system (Huang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025), which poses significant challenges due to the coupling of two non-convex systems. In our framework, we explicitly model the universal knowledge (also known as meta-knowledge) between the source task and the target tasks, and we assume that an α-proportion of the upstream model’s weights are inherited by the downstream model. For the downstream model, the remaining weights are randomly initialized. Based on the above modeling, we analyze the roles of the three crucial factors: (1) the universal knowledge between the source task and the target tasks; (2) the training sample size for the upstream model; (3) the noise level in the source task. It shows that more inherited parameters, larger training sample size for the upstream model, and less noise in the upstream task can improve the performance of the downstream model. The results are consistent with the empirical performance of parameter transfer, providing theoretical support for its effectiveness. The contributions of our paper are as follows.\n\n• To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to establish a theoretical framework for parameter transfer. Specifically, we prove that when the training sample size, signal strength, noise level, and dimension of both the upstream and downstream models satisfy a certain condition, the test error rate approaches the Bayes optimal. The condition is tight. In the opposite regime of this condition, we prove that the test error remains a constant away from the Bayes optimal. These results together demonstrate the sharpness of our theory and provide a rigorous explanation for the empirical success of parameter transfer.\n\n• We provide theoretical explanation when parameter transfer outperforms direct training from random initialization. Specifically, we identify the critical roles of three factors in determining its effectiveness: the norm of the universal knowledge between the source task and target tasks, the sample size of the source task, and the noise level present in the source data. Our analysis reveals how these factors jointly influence the success of parameter transfer. In particular, we show that parameter transfer allows the downstream model to inherit universal knowledge of guaranteed strength, thereby improving generalization and mitigating the effect of noise memorization in the target tasks. These results offer a rigorous characterization of the advantage of inherited"

Recent studies have reported such phenomena (Zhang et al., 2022; Go et al., 2023; Zu et al., 2025), but the underlying mechanisms remain theoretically underexplored. In this work, we theoretically proved the existence of the negative transfer. Particularly, when the shared signal between the source and target tasks is very weak, even a well-trained upstream model with a large sample size or low noise level can harm the target task. The key mechanism is that the weight norm learned from the upstream model becomes excessively large. When transferred, these over-amplified weights fail to enhance the weak shared signal in the target task but instead magnify task-specific noise, hence degrading test performance. Our results thus offer rigorous theoretical guidance for the effective application of the parameter transfer methodology: parameter transfer should be designed to extract and transfer strong shared features, which necessitates careful selection of the source dataset to ensure sufficient relevance and signal quality.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nTransfer Learning and Applications: Transfer learning (TL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in machine learning, aiming to leverage knowledge from a source domain to improve learning performance in a related but different target domain. Tan et al. (2015) introduces an intermediate domain to bridge source and target domains using non-negative matrix tri-factorization, enabling label propagation across heterogeneous spaces. Li et al. (2013) augments source and target features by projecting them into a common subspace while preserving domain-specific information, enabling knowledge transfer across different dimensions. Tsai et al. (2016) learns a transformation matrix to project source data into a PCA-based target subspace, aligning both marginal and conditional distributions for heterogeneous domain adaptation. Ye et al. (2021) rectifies heterogeneous model parameters by learning a semantic mapping function, enabling transfer of prior knowledge from source to target even with differing label spaces. In recent years, transfer learning has found widespread applications across domains. Gardner et al. (2024) demonstrates how large-scale pretraining on a diverse tabular corpus enables strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization to unseen tabular tasks, effectively transferring knowledge across domains without task-specific fine-tuning. Wang et al. (2025) proposes a minimax-optimal transfer learning algorithm for nonparametric contextual dynamic pricing under covariate shift, leveraging source data to improve target-domain pricing decisions. Garau-Luis et al. (2024) presents a multi-modal transfer learning framework that effectively bridges pre-trained DNA, RNA, and protein encoders to predict RNA isoform expression. (Wang et al., 2022) selects certain layers as learngene based on gradient information observed in the upstream model, and subsequently stacks these learngene layers with some randomly initialized layers to initialize downstream models. For further discussion on transfer learning theory, please refer to Section G.\n\nNeural Tangent Kernel and Feature Learning: With the advancement of deep learning, analyzing the dynamics underlying neural networks has become increasingly meaningful. Jacot et al. (2018) introduce the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, which effectively characterizes the dynamics of sufficiently over-parameterized neural networks and explains how they fit data during training. Building on this, Cao and Gu (2019, 2020) further investigated the generalization capabilities of neural networks in the over-parameterized regime. At the core of these studies is the observation that, under sufficiently over-parameterization, neural network weights can be well-approximated by a linear system (Yu et al., 2023; Benjamin et al., 2024; Fu and Wang, 2024) and"

This phenomenon is known as lazy training (Chizat et al., 2019; Ghorbani et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2023), which cannot explain the superior performance of neural networks well. Besides NTK regime, another line of studies explores benign overfitting in neural network, which is called feature learning (Zou et al., 2023; Cao et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2025). Feature learning theory typically assumes a specific data generation model and estimates how the weights learn the signals and noise present in the data. Feature learning theory differs from NTK in two key aspects: 1) Feature learning theory employs small initializations, which allow the learning process to dominate and avoid lazy training. 2) Feature learning system can be a highly nonlinear system, and its dynamics are closer to those of real neural networks. For example, Allen-Zhu and Li (2023) characterizes ensemble learning and knowledge distillation. Meng et al. (2024) investigates that CNNs can learn XOR problem efficiently. Chen et al. (2023) studies how the network memorize the spurious and invariant features on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Shang et al. (2024) investigate the two layer neural networks and discover that the initialization of second layers matters in the generalization.\n\n## 3 Problem Setting\n\nNotations. For sequences {x_n} and {y_n}, the relation x_n = O(y_n) indicates the existence of absolute constants C_1 > 0 and N > 0 such that |x_n| ≤ C_1|y_n| holds uniformly for all n ≥ N. Similarly, we write x_n = Ω(y_n) if y_n = O(x_n), and we denote x_n = Θ(y_n) when both x_n = O(y_n) and x_n = Ω(y_n) hold. We adopt \\tilde{O}(·), \\tilde{Ω}(·), and \\tilde{Θ}(·) to hide some logarithmic terms. For any event 𝔈, we denote its indicator function by 1(𝔈), which equals 1 if 𝔈 occurs and 0 otherwise. Furthermore, for non-negative quantities x_1, …, x_k, we use the shorthand y = poly(x_1, …, x_k) to express that y is bounded above by a positive power of max{x_1, …, x_k}, i.e., y = O(max{x_1, …, x_k}^D) for some constant D > 0. y = polylog(x) indicates that y grows polynomially with respect to log x.\n\nThen, we introduce the data generation model, the network model we adapt and the algorithm of parameter transfer. Let \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2 ∈ ℝ^d be three fixed signal vectors with \\mathbf{u} ⟂ \\mathbf{v}_1 and \\mathbf{u} ⟂ \\mathbf{v}_2. The data is given in the following definition.\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Data in Task 1). Each data point (\\mathbf{x}, y) with \\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{x}^{(1)\\top}, \\mathbf{x}^{(2)\\top})^\\top ∈ ℝ^{2d} is generated from the following distribution 𝒟_1: 1. The data label y ∈ {±1} is generated as a Rademacher random variable. 2. A noise vector \\boldsymbol{\\xi} is generated from the Gaussian distribution 𝒩(\\mathbf{0}, \\sigma_{p,1}^2(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^\\top/\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^2 - \\mathbf{v}_1\\mathbf{v}_1^\\top/\\|\\mathbf{v}_1\\|_2^2)). 3. One of \\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \\mathbf{x}^{(2)} is randomly selected and assigned as y · (\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_1) which is the signal part, and the other is assigned as \\boldsymbol{\\xi} which is the noise part.\n\nDefinition 3.2 (Data in Task 2). Each data point (\\mathbf{x}, y) with \\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{x}^{(1)\\top}, \\mathbf{x}^{(2)\\top})^\\top ∈ ℝ^{2d} is generated from the following distribution 𝒟_2: 1. The data label y ∈ {±1} is generated as a Rademacher random variable. 2. A noise vector \\boldsymbol{\\xi} is generated from the Gaussian distribution 𝒩(\\mathbf{0}, \\sigma_{p,2}^2(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^\\top/\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^2 - \\mathbf{v}_2\\mathbf{v}_2^\\top/\\|\\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2^2)). 3. One of \\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \\mathbf{x}^{(2)} is randomly selected and assigned as y · (\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_2) which is the signal part, and the other is assigned as \\boldsymbol{\\xi} which is the noise part.\n\nWe divide the data input into the signal and noise patch. Such data generation model has been widely used (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2023; Cao et al., 2022; Jelassi and Li, 2022; Kou et al., 2023; Meng et al., 2024). For the signal patch, the datasets in Task 1 and Task 2 share a universal signal vector denoted by \\mathbf{u}, while also containing task-specific signal vectors \\mathbf{v}_1 and \\mathbf{v}_2 respectively. For the noise patch, we assume that it is orthogonal to the signal patch for simplicity. Although this orthogonality assumption simplifies the analysis, it can be naturally extended to more general cases where the"

The CNN filters are applied to both the signal part and the noise part. Specifically, the network is defined as\n\nf(W; x) = F_{+1}(W; x) − F_{−1}(W; x),   F_j(W; x) = (1/m) ∑_{r=1}^{m} [σ(⟨w_{j,r}, x^{(1)}⟩) + σ(⟨w_{j,r}, x^{(2)}⟩)].\n\nHere, m is the number of convolutional filters, and σ(z) = max{0, z} is the activation function. Moreover, w_{j,r} denotes the weight for the r-th filter, W_j is the weight matrix associated with F_j, and W collects all the weight matrices w_{j,r} for j ∈ {±1}. Such a convolutional neural network is widely used in feature learning theory. Then, defining the cross-entropy loss function ℓ(z) = log(1 + exp(−z)), the training losses for Task 1 and Task 2 can be written as\n\nL_Task1(W) = (1/N_1) ∑_{i∈[N_1]} ℓ(y_{i,1} f(W; x_{i,1}));   L_Task2(W) = (1/N_2) ∑_{i∈[N_2]} ℓ(y_{i,2} f(W; x_{i,2})).\n\nWith a well-defined training objective, we present the parameter transfer training procedure in Algorithm 1, alongside the standard training baseline in Algorithm 2.

      "text": "The algorithm used in this work randomly samples weights from the upstream model. In contrast, most existing methods are typically designed to extract and transfer strong shared features. In addition, it is worth noting that in the upstream model, practitioners often leverage larger datasets and more complex model architectures to extract transferable knowledge. Such pretraining processes may incur substantial computational costs, sometimes exceeding the capacity of local computing resources. Furthermore, as we will discuss in the following section, transferring parameters from the upstream model to the downstream task is not universally beneficial. In some stringent scenarios, inappropriate inheritance of parameters can even degrade the test performance of the downstream model, which is also reported in the literature.\n\n## 4 Main Results\n\nIn this section, we present our main results. Our main results aim to show the theoretical guarantees with probability at least $$1 - \\delta$$ for some small $$\\delta > 0$$. With such probability, we show that the training loss will converge below some arbitrarily small $$\\varepsilon > 0$$, while the test accuracy can have different performance based on the training sample size $$N_1, N_2$$, the dimension $$d$$ and the inherited parameters $$\\alpha$$ etc. We define $$T^* = \\eta^{-1}\\text{poly}(n, d, \\varepsilon, m)$$ to be the maximum admissible number of training iterations. To establish the results, we require several conditions that are summarized below.\n\nCondition 4.1. Define $$n = \\max\\{N_1, N_2\\}$$. Suppose there exists a sufficiently large constant $$C$$, such that the following hold with $$\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}_1$$ or $$\\mathbf{v}_2$$, and $$\\sigma_p = \\sigma_{p,1}$$ or $$\\sigma_{p,2}$$:\n\n1. Dimension $$d$$ satisfies: $$d = \\tilde{\\Omega}(\\max\\{n\\sigma_p^{-2}\\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\\|_2^2, n^2\\})$$.\n2. Training sample size $$n$$ and neural network width satisfy: $$m \\geq C\\log(n/\\delta), n \\geq C\\log(m/\\delta)$$.\n3. The norm of the signal satisfies $$\\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\\|_2^2 = \\Omega(\\sigma_p^2\\log(n/\\delta))$$.\n4. The standard deviation of Gaussian initialization $$\\sigma_0$$ is appropriately chosen such that\n   $$\\sigma_0 = O\\left(\\left(\\max\\left\\{\\sigma_p d/\\sqrt{n}, \\sqrt{\\log(m/\\delta)} \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\\|_2\\right\\}\\right)^{-1}\\right).$$\n5. The learning rate $$\\eta$$ satisfies\n   $$\\eta \\leq O\\left(\\left(\\max\\left\\{\\sigma_p^2 d^{3/2}/(n^2 m \\sqrt{\\log(m/\\delta)}), \\sigma_p^2 d/n, \\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\\|_2^2/m\\right\\}\\right)^{-1}\\right).$$\n\nThe first two conditions on $$d$$, $$n$$, and $$m$$ are imposed to ensure the desired concentration results hold, accounting for randomness in both the data distribution and random initialization. The assumption on the width $$d$$ ensures that the learning dynamics operate in the over-parameterized regime. Similar assumptions have been adopted in a series of recent works (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2023; Cao et al., 2022; Kou et al., 2023; Meng et al., 2024). The condition on the initialization scale $$\\sigma_0$$ requires it to be sufficiently small, so that the impact of initialization on training remains negligible. This allows the learning dynamics to dominate the training process, moving beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime. Finally, the smallness condition on the learning rate $$\\eta$$ is a standard technical assumption, ensuring the stability of the analysis. Under Condition 4.1, we have the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 4.2 (With parameter transfer). Suppose that percentage $$\\alpha$$ ($$0 < \\alpha \\leq 1$$) of the upstream model’s weights are inherited. For any $$\\varepsilon, \\delta > 0$$, if Condition 4.1 holds, then there exist"

It highlights the critical role of universal knowledge in parameter transfer, as well as the influence of inherited parameters, the sample size of the source task, and the signal-to-noise ratio. Specifically, the theorem shows that in the upstream model, generalization performance improves when the sample size of the source task, the amount of inherited parameters, and the strength of universal knowledge are sufficiently large, and when the noise level in the upstream model is small. Conversely, in the absence of universal knowledge, inherited parameters, or with a small sample size, such benefits do not emerge, regardless of other factors.\n\nTheorem 4.3 (Without parameter transfer, Previous results in Kou et al.

If $N_2\\|\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2^4 \\leq C_3'\\sigma_{p,2}^4 d$, then the CNN trained by gradient descent can only achieve sub-optimal error rate: $\\mathbb{P}(y f(\\mathbf{W}^{(t)};\\mathbf{x}) < 0) \\geq 0.1$.\n\nTheorem 4.3 characterizes the generalization performance of networks without parameter transfer. We define the following key quantity $\\Gamma = \\frac{\\alpha^2 N_1 \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^4}{\\sigma_{p,1}^2 \\sigma_{p,2}^2 d}$. Under Condition 4.1, we observe in the theorem above that large value of $\\Gamma$ is a sufficient condition in determining the success of parameter transfer.

Our experiments vary the training sample sizes N1 and N2, noise levels σp,1 and σp,2, and the universal signal strength ||u||2. The test sample size is 1000 for all experiments. Given the dimension d and the signals u, v1, v2, the data in Task 1 and Task 2 are generated according to Definitions 3.1 and 3.2. Specifically, we set d = 2000, and the signals are constructed via the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process to ensure mutual orthogonality in the vector space. Then, we generate the noise vector ξ from a Gaussian distribution.\n\nWe adopt the two-layer CNN model defined in Section 3 for both the upstream model and the downstream model. The number of filters is m = 40. All models are trained with gradient descent with a learning rate η = 0.01. For all weights without using parameter transfer, they are initialized as N(0, σ0^2), where σ0 = 0.01. The upstream models are trained for T1 = 800 epochs, while the downstream models are trained for T2 = 400 epochs. Our goal is to explain the effect of parameter transfer under different settings.\n\n1. In the first setting, we fix the noise levels σp,1 = σp,2 = 5 and the sample size of the target dataset N2 = 100. Then, we compare the test accuracy under different sample sizes of the source dataset N1, and the results are shown in Figure 1(a)."

The x-axis is the value of $\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2$ and the y-axis is the dimension $d$. (b) and (c) display the truncated heatmap of test accuracy. Accuracies smaller than 0.65 (0.70) are set to 0 (yellow) and the others are set to 1 (blue).\n\n2. In the second setting, we fix $N_1 = N_2 = 100$ and the noise level in Task 2 $\\sigma_{p,2} = 5$. Then, we compare the test accuracy under different noise levels in Task 1 $\\sigma_{p,1}$, and the results are shown in Figure 1b.\n\n3. In the third setting, we fix $N_1 = 1000, N_2 = 100$, the noise level of all data $\\sigma_{p,1} = \\sigma_{p,2} = 15$, and $\\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2 = 3$. Then, we compare the test accuracy under different $\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2$, and the results are shown in Figure 1c. Note that it is important to fix $\\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2$ instead of fixing $\\|\\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2 = 3$. Otherwise, the performance improvement may be attributed to a stronger signal rather than parameter transfer.\n\n4. In the fourth setting, we set $N_1 = 1000, N_2 = 100, \\sigma_{p,1} = \\sigma_{p,2} = 15, \\alpha = 0.5$ so that the inherited weights play a dominant role in Task 2. According to Theorem 4.2, the phase transition happens when $\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2$ and $d$ break the balance. We plot the heatmap of test accuracy under different $d$ and $\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2$ in Figure 2a. Moreover, the truncated heatmaps are also shown in Figures 2b and 2c.\n\nFigure 1 demonstrates that increasing training sample size for the upstream model, reducing the noise in Task 1, or enhancing the universal knowledge in the signal can all improve the performance of parameter transfer. In particular, in Figure 1c, we find that when $\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2 = 0$, parameter transfer leads to a degradation in test accuracy. This implies that there is little universal knowledge in the signal; it may lead to negative transfer, thereby impairing the model’s performance on new tasks. As shown in Figure 2, increasing $\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2$ or decreasing $d$ will improve the effect of parameter transfer. The universal knowledge in the signal is critical for the success of parameter transfer. These conclusions are intuitive and consistent with our theoretical analysis.\n\n## 6 Real Data Experiments\n\nIn this section, we perform real data experiments to show that parameter transfer is effective and is impacted by several factors: the training sample size of Task 1 and the noise level in Task 1.\n\nExperiments on Varying $N_1$. We investigated the impact of the training sample size of Task 1 on the efficacy of the inherited parameters. Specifically, we randomly select 2 classes from CIFAR-10 (or 20 classes from CIFAR-100) as Task 2, and then randomly choose $k$ classes from the remaining categories as Task 1. For example, when $N_1/N_2 = 3$, we select 6 (or 60) classes from CIFAR-10 (or CIFAR-100) as Task 1. We use ResNet-101 as the upstream model and use ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 as the downstream models. As presented in Tab. 1, the results indicate that as the number of samples in Task 1 increases, parameter transfer demonstrates progressively better performance."

For example, employing a ResNet-101 upstream model and a ResNet-34 downstream model on CIFAR-100, the performance increment is 2.6% when the source tasks are 40 classes. This increment rises to 12% when the source tasks are 80 classes.\n\nExperiments on Varying $\\sigma_{p,2}$. Furthermore, we explore the effect of different proportions of added noise on the target tasks. Initially, both Task 1 and Task 2 inherently contain intrinsic noise. Subsequently, we designed an experiment where we progressively introduced noise into Task 2, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Specifically, we add Gaussian noise $\\xi \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{p,2}^2)$ to the original image. We use ResNet-101 as the upstream model and use ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 as the downstream models. The experimental results indicate that as noise is continuously added to Task 2, the performance of inherited parameters consistently surpasses that of methods without parameter transfer. As presented in Fig. 3a, where the noise values gradually increase from 1 to 20, the advantage of parameter transfer not only persists but also tends to widen over time.\n\nExperiments on Vision Transformers. We adopt DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021) as the architecture for both the upstream and downstream models. Specifically, both models are DeiT-Base, which consists of 12 multi-head attention blocks and 12 layers, totaling approximately 86M parameters. The upstream model is pretrained on ImageNet-2012 (Deng et al., 2009), achieving an accuracy of 81.8%. We select the 9th, 10th, and 11th layers from the upstream model as inherited parameters and transfer them to the downstream models. The downstream models are then fine-tuned on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. We compare the performance of downstream models with parameter transfer against those with random initialization. The results are presented in Figure 4 in the appendix.\n\n## 7 Discussion\n\nIn this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of the parameter transfer mechanism within the framework of a two-layer ReLU convolutional neural network.

Test accuracy of ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 as downstream models on (a) CIFAR-10 and (b) CIFAR-100 under different noise level σ_{p,2}. “w/” and “w/o” denote models trained with and without parameter transfer, respectively.\n\nupstream and downstream models, the sample size of the source task, and the noise level in the source task, play crucial roles in determining the effectiveness of parameter transfer. These theoretical findings are further supported by numerical simulations. Additionally, we conduct extensive real-world experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, employing modern neural architectures such as ResNet, VGG, and ViT, all of which consistently validate our theoretical predictions.\n\nA possible limitation of our theoretical framework is its focus on shallow neural networks. Nevertheless, even in this simplified setting, the theoretical understanding of parameter transfer remains highly non-trivial. Without first establishing a rigorous foundation for shallow networks, it would be challenging to develop solid theoretical insights for deeper and more complex architectures. This work thus serves as a necessary first step, and several promising directions remain for future research. One important direction is to extend our theoretical analysis to deep neural networks, which involves understanding more intricate dynamical systems arising from their training processes. Another interesting direction is to design regularization techniques that can guide the inherited model to select more effective weights rather than random transfer. Developing a theoretical framework to understand how regularization influences weight selection in parameter transfer remains an open and important question.\n\nReferences\n\nALLEN-ZHU, Z. and LI, Y.

      "text": "A Proof Sketch\n\nIn this section, we briefly give the proof sketch of Theorem 4.2. We define T*, T** := η^{-1} poly(n, d, ε, m) to be the maximum admissible number of training iterations in systems 1 and 2. Readers may refer to Section B for the calculation of gradients and the meaning of the notations.\n\nOur proof is based on a rigorous analysis of the training dynamics of CNN filters. Note that the activation functions are always non-negative, hence F_{+1}(W; x) always contributes to the class +1, and F_{-1}(W; x) always contributes to the class −1. Our test error is calculated by rigorously comparing the output between F_{+1}(W; x) and F_{-1}(W; x). By the definition of F_{+1} or F_{-1}, it is clear that the inner product of w_{j,r} and the signal u + v_2 in task 2 plays a key role in achieving high test accuracy.\n\nOur analysis focuses on the training dynamics of w_{j,r}^{(t)}. By gradient calculation, w_{j,r}^{(t)} in the downstream model can be decomposed as\nw_{j,r}^{(t)} = w_{j,r}^{(0)} + j · γ_{j,r}^{(t)} · ||u||_2^{-2} · u + j · γ_{j,r,1}^{(t)} · ||v_1||_2^{-2} · v_1 + j · γ_{j,r,2}^{(t)} · ||v_2||_2^{-2} · v_2\n+ ∑_{i=1}^{N_1} ρ_{j,r,i,1}^{(t)} · ||ξ_{i,1}||_2^{-2} · ξ_{i,1} + ∑_{i=1}^{N_2} ρ_{j,r,i,2}^{(t)} · ||ξ_{i,2}||_2^{-2} · ξ_{i,2}.\n\nThis is because the update direction of w_{j,r}^{(t)} is in the space span{u, v_1, v_2, ξ_{i,1}, ξ_{i,2}}. Readers may refer to Section B for the details. From the algorithm in Section 3, all the coefficients experience two different systems. We proceed with the analysis in the first system. With the precise characterization in the first system, we then transfer the whole analysis into the second system. Readers may refer to Lemma B.2 for the two systems.\n\nThe following lemma constitutes the core technical results in our analysis of signal learning dynamics and noise memorization behavior in the first system. It is clear from the decomposition above that the coefficients γ (i.e., γ_{j,r}) are related to the growth of signal learning in the neural networks, and the coefficients ρ (i.e., ρ_{j,r,i,1}) are related to the growth of noise memorization. We define x̄_t and x_t to help give a precise characterization of signal learning and noise memorization. Let\nκ_A = (4 C_2 N_1 ||u + v_1||_2^2)/(σ_{p,1}^2 d) · log(T*) + (4 C_1 + 64) N_1 √(log(4 N_1^2/δ)/d) · log(T*) + 8 √(log(12 m N_1/δ)) · σ_0 σ_{p,1} √d,\nand define x̄_t^A, x_t^A to be the unique solutions of\nx_t^A + b^A e^{x_t^A} = c^A t + b^A,\nx̄_t^A + b̄^A e^{x̄_t^A} = c̄^A t + b̄^A,\nwhere b̄^A = e^{-κ_A/2}, c̄^A = (3 η σ_{p,1}^2 d)/(2 N_1 m), b^A = e^{κ_A/2}, and c^A = (η σ_{p,1}^2 d)/(5 N_1 m). We have the following lemma.\n\nLemma A.1. Under Condition 4.1, it holds that\n(η ||u||_2^2)/(c̄^A m) · x̄_{t-2}^A − (2η ||u||_2^2)/m ≤ γ_{j,r}^{A,(t)} ≤ (η ||u||_2^2)/(c^A m) · x_{t-1}^A − (2η ||u||_2^2)/m,\n(η ||v_1||_2^2)/(c̄^A m) · x̄_{t-2}^A − (2η ||v_1||_2^2)/m ≤ γ_{j,r,1}^{A,(t)} ≤ (η ||v_1||_2^2)/(c^A m) · x_{t-1}^A − (2η ||v_1||_2^2)/m."

A key step in establishing Lemma A.1 lies in demonstrating the balanced nature of the per-sample training losses, namely that the ratio $\\ell_i'^{(t)}/\\ell_{i'}'^{(t)}$ remains uniformly bounded by a constant for all iterations $t$ and any $i,i'\\in[N_1]$. Readers may refer to the proof of Proposition D.5 for a detailed argument on this balancing property. With the balanced loss established, we proceed to apply continuous approximation techniques, following a similar approach to that of Meng et al. (2024), and obtain the lemma above.\n\nWith the precise characterization of $\\gamma$ and $\\rho$ in system 1, we then transfer the analysis to the second system. The main challenges in the second system are related to the analysis of the system with different initializations. In our analysis of the second system, for the universal part of $\\gamma^{D,(t)}_{j,r}$, we directly define a new term $\\gamma^{D,(t)}_{j,r}-\\gamma^{D,(T^*+1)}_{j,r}$, and analysis is directly performed on this term. Combining the analysis in system 1, we define\n$$\\kappa_D=\\frac{4C_2N_2\\|\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2^2}{\\sigma_{p,2}^2d}\\log(T^{**})+\\frac{4C_2N_1\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^2}{\\sigma_{p,1}^2d}\\log(T^*)+16\\sqrt{\\log(12mN_2/\\delta)}\\cdot\\sigma_0\\sigma_{p,2}\\sqrt{d}$$\n$$+(4C_1+64)\\Big(N_1\\frac{\\sigma_{p,2}}{\\sigma_{p,1}}+N_2\\Big)\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(4(N_1^2+N_2^2)/\\delta)}{d}}\\log(T^{**}).$$\n\nWith the transfer from system 1 into system 2, we give the characterization of noise memorization and signal learning in system 2.

The coefficient in system 2 can be characterized as in the following lemma.\n\nLemma A.2. Under Condition 4.1, for $T^*+1\\le t\\le T^{**}$, it holds that\n$$\\frac{\\eta\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^2}{\\bar{c}^D m}\\,x^D_{t-2}-\\frac{2\\eta\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^2}{m}\\le \\gamma^{D,(t)}_{j,r}-\\gamma^{D,(T^*+1)}_{j,r}\\le \\frac{\\eta\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^2}{c^D m}\\,\\bar{x}^D_{t-1}-\\frac{2\\eta\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^2}{m},$$\n$$\\frac{\\eta\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2^2}{\\bar{c}^D m}\\,x^D_{t-2}-\\frac{2\\eta\\|\\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2^2}{m}\\le \\gamma^{D,(t)}_{j,r,2}\\le \\frac{\\eta\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2^2}{c^D m}\\,\\bar{x}^D_{t-1}-\\frac{2\\eta\\|\\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2^2}{m}.$$\n\nMoreover, for the noise memorization term, it holds that\n$$\\frac{N_2}{12}\\big(x^D_{t-2}-x^D_1\\big)\\le \\sum_{i\\in[N_2]}\\underline{\\rho}^{D,(t)}_{j,r,i,2}\\le 5N_2\\bar{x}^D_{t-1}.$$\n\nWith Lemma A.1 and A.2, our analysis then focuses on how much the training data noises $\\xi_i$ have been memorized by the CNN filters, and then the training loss and the test error can be calculated and bounded based on their definitions.

Then, we complete the proof. □\n\n## E The Second System\n\nTo clearly distinguish the processes of Task 1 and Task 2, we assume that the upstream model is trained on Task 1 for $T^*$ epochs. At this point, a subset of the weights (i.e., inherited parameters, $1 \\leq r \\leq \\alpha m$) is transferred to the downstream model, while the remaining weights ($\\alpha m < r \\leq m$) are randomly initialized. For simplicity, we assume that at $t = T^* + 1$, the downstream model has completed initialization and begins training on Task 2. So we have\n\n$$\\mathbf{w}_{j,r}^{D,(T^*+1)} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathbf{w}_{j,r}^{A,(T^*)} & \\text{if } 1 \\leq r \\leq \\alpha m, \\\\\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{w}}_{j,r}^{D,(T^*)} & \\text{if } \\alpha m < r \\leq m,\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{\\mathbf{w}}_{j,r}^{D,(T^*)}$, $\\alpha m < r \\leq m$, are the re-initialized weights. To distinguish the weights used in Task 1 from those in Task 2, we use the superscript $D$ to denote the weights and coefficients of the downstream model on Task 2. Specifically, because the coefficients $\\gamma_{j,r,1}^{(t)}$, $\\bar{\\rho}_{j,r,i,1}^{(t)}$ and $\\rho_{j,r,i,1}^{(t)}$ are updated only on Task 1, we keep the superscript $A$ for them so that readers can find the results of system 1 easily.\n\n### E.1 Coefficient Scale Analysis\n\nIn this section, we give the analysis of coefficient scale on Task 2 for $T^* + 1 \\leq t \\leq T^{**}$.\n\n**Proposition E.1.** Under Condition 4.1, and define $n = \\max\\{N_1, N_2\\}$, for $T^* + 1 \\leq t \\leq T^{**}$, it holds that\n\n$$0 \\leq \\bar{\\rho}_{j,r,i,2}^{D,(t)} \\leq 4\\log(T^{**}),\\tag{E.1}$$\n\n$$0 \\geq \\rho_{j,r,i,2}^{D,(t)} \\geq -2\\sqrt{\\log(12mN_2/\\delta)}\\cdot \\sigma_0\\sigma_{p,2}\\sqrt{d}\n- C_1\\!\\left(N_1\\frac{\\sigma_{p,2}}{\\sigma_{p,1}} + N_2\\right)\\!\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(4(N_1^2 + N_2^2)/\\delta)}{d}}\\log(T^{**})\n\\geq -4\\log(T^{**}),\\tag{E.2}$$\n\n$$0 \\leq \\gamma_{j,r}^{D,(t)} - \\gamma_{j,r}^{D,(T^*+1)} \\leq \\frac{C_2 N_2 \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2^2}{\\sigma_{p,2}^2 d}\\log(T^{**}),\\tag{E.3}$$\n\n$$0 \\leq \\gamma_{j,r,2}^{D,(t)} \\leq \\frac{C_2 N_2 \\|\\mathbf{v}_2\\|_2^2}{\\sigma_{p,2}^2 d}\\log(T^{**}),\\tag{E.4}$$\n\nfor all $r \\in [m]$, $j \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$, $i \\in [n]$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are two absolute constants.\n\nWe will prove Proposition E.1 by induction.

The seminal bias-learning framework introduced by Baxter (2000) first quantified the benefits of a shared inductive bias across tasks. Later works refined this picture, establishing finite-sample guarantees for representation-based transfer (Maurer et al., 2016), information-theoretic upper bounds on the joint risk (Wang, 2018; Wu et al., 2024), and minimax-optimal sample-complexity characterisations in linear regimes (Tripuraneni et al., 2020). Yi et al. (2023) proves that conditional independence from spurious attributes given the label is sufficient for OOD robustness under correlation shift, and introduces the Conditional Spurious Variation (CSV) metric that directly controls the OOD generalization error."
