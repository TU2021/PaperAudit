          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core strengths as the novel, rigorous theoretical analysis of parameter transfer dynamics, the explanation for negative transfer, and the supporting empirical validation. The alignment is very high, with Review B simply providing more technical detail on the same points.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews strongly agree on the main weaknesses: the unrealistic assumption of random parameter sampling (vs. layer-wise transfer) and the stylized, limiting nature of the theoretical model. However, Review A also notes the limited comparison to prior work and the narrow focus on classification, points which are absent in Review B.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their overall judgment, portraying the paper as a significant theoretical contribution whose practical impact is limited by idealized assumptions. Both focus on the tension between theoretical novelty and practical applicability, with minor divergence on a few secondary weaknesses."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the novel theoretical analysis of parameter transfer dynamics, the mechanistic explanation for positive and negative transfer, and the empirical validation on real-world benchmarks. Review B provides much greater detail by citing specific theorems and proof techniques, but the high-level points are identical to Review A.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews highlight the same primary weaknesses, namely the mismatch between the theoretical assumption of random parameter sampling and real-world practice, and the simplified nature of the theoretical model. While Review B adds more specific technical critiques (e.g., undefined Bayes-optimal reference) and Review A mentions limited comparison to prior work, their main concerns are strongly aligned.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high substantive alignment, as both frame the paper as a valuable theoretical contribution whose practical impact is limited by simplifying assumptions. Review B is significantly more detailed and provides specific evidence for its claims, but its overall judgment and focus on the key trade-offs are highly consistent with Review A's assessment."

However, Review B identifies several additional major weaknesses absent from Review A, such as insufficient experimental details for reproducibility, a lack of negative transfer evidence on real data, and undefined theoretical terms.",

While their core message is consistent, Review B is substantially more detailed and identifies a wider range of specific weaknesses, preventing a near-perfect match."
