Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several clear internal inconsistencies and integrity risks have been identified that materially affect the paper's scientific validity and trustworthiness.

### **Integrity Risk and Consistency Report**

**1. Unsubstantiated Theoretical Claim Regarding Negative Transfer**

The manuscript repeatedly claims to have theoretically proven the existence of negative transfer, where parameter transfer (PT) results in worse performance than training from scratch.

-   **Evidence (Claim):** The Introduction states, "our framework... reveals, for the first time in theory, the precise conditions under which negative transfer arises" (Block #2) and "we theoretically proved the existence of the negative transfer" (Block #4). This claim is formalized in Proposition 4.4, Part 2 (Block #17), which asserts that under certain conditions, "parameter transfer is detrimental to the downstream model, i.e., negative transfer."
-   **Evidence (Contradiction):** The core theoretical results presented, Theorem 4.2 (With PT) and Theorem 4.3 (Without PT), establish conditions under which each method achieves either near-optimal or sub-optimal (error ≥ 0.1) performance. However, these theorems do not provide a direct comparison of the error rates between the two methods. The provided proofs in the appendix (e.g., Theorem E.12, Block #106) also only derive bounds for each case individually.
-   **Finding:** No direct proof or derivation is provided in the manuscript to substantiate the claim that the error rate with parameter transfer can be strictly greater than the error rate without it. The theoretical analysis shows when PT performs poorly, but not that it performs *worse* than the alternative. The claim of a theoretical proof of negative transfer appears to be an overstatement of the presented results. While empirical evidence for negative transfer is shown (Figure 1c, Block #19), the theoretical backing for this specific claim is missing from the manuscript.

**2. Inconsistency Between Theoretical Focus and Experimental Validation**

An experiment designed to validate the theory shows results that are not explained by, and appear to contradict the intuition from, the paper's theoretical framework.

-   **Evidence (Theory):** The paper's main theoretical contribution is analyzing the impact of *source task* properties (sample size `N1`, noise `σ_p,1`, and universal signal `||u||`) on the success of parameter transfer. The key theoretical quantity `Γ` (Block #14), which is presented as a sufficient condition for PT's success, is inversely proportional to the *target task* noise variance (`σ_p,2^2`). This implies that as target task noise increases, the condition for beneficial transfer becomes harder to satisfy.
-   **Evidence (Experiment):** The experiment in Section 6, "Experiments on Varying `σ_{p,2}`" (Block #28), investigates the effect of varying the target task noise. The results in Figure 3 (Blocks #34, #35) show that as `σ_p,2` increases, the performance gap between models with and without PT widens, with the text noting "the advantage of parameter transfer not only persists but also tends to widen" (Block #28).
-   **Finding:** The experimental result suggests that PT becomes *more* advantageous as target task noise increases. This is a significant finding but is counter-intuitive based on the provided theoretical condition `Γ >= C`. The manuscript presents this experiment as validation of its theory but fails to explain or even acknowledge this apparent contradiction.

**3. Contradictory and Potentially Erroneous Technical Lemmas in the Appendix**

The appendix contains significant inconsistencies and apparent errors within the core technical lemmas that underpin the main theoretical results for the downstream model.

-   **Evidence:** Lemma A.2 in the proof sketch (Block #42) provides bounds on the growth of signal-learning coefficients for the downstream model. It states that the lower bound is a function of `x^D` and the upper bound is a function of `x̄^D`. However, the full version of this lemma in the appendix, Lemma E.9 (Block #102), states the opposite: the lower bound is a function of `x^D` and the upper bound is a function of `x̄^D`. Furthermore, the proof of Lemma E.9 (Block #103) appears to contain multiple typos, including using `x̄` where `x` is expected based on the definitions, making the derivation difficult to verify.
-   **Finding:** These contradictions and errors in the core mathematical analysis of the downstream training dynamics (the "second system") undermine the credibility of the theoretical guarantees presented in Theorem 4.2 and Theorem E.12.

**4. Minor but Notable Inconsistencies**

-   **Inconsistent Notation for Training Duration:** Algorithm 1 and 2 (Blocks #8, #9) use `T*` for the training duration of both upstream and downstream models. However, the numerical experiments use different values: `T1 = 800` epochs for upstream and `T2 = 400` for downstream (Block #18). This creates ambiguity in the methodology.
-   **Incorrect Cross-Reference:** Theorem 4.3 (Block #14) refers to a non-existent "Condition 3.1". This should likely be Condition 4.1, but the error indicates a lack of careful preparation.

**Conclusion:**

The manuscript suffers from several high-impact internal inconsistencies. The most critical issue is the unsubstantiated claim of a theoretical proof for negative transfer, which misrepresents the scope of the provided theoretical results. Additionally, a key experiment shows results that are not reconciled with the theory, and the appendix contains contradictory lemmas that question the correctness of the downstream model analysis. These issues must be addressed to ensure the scientific validity of the work.
