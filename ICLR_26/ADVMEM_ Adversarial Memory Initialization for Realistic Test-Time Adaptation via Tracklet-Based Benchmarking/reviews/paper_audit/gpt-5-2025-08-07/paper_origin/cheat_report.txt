Academic integrity and internal consistency risk report

Summary of high-impact issues identified

1) Misreferenced and duplicated tables that materially hinder verification of claims
- Claim-to-table mismatch in the Abstract and main text:
  - Abstract: “equipping SHOT-IM with ADVMEM reduces error rates by 44% in Tracklet-wise i.i.d. settings (see Table 2).” Evidence: Block #8. Table 2 (Block #21) only lists method descriptions (adaptation strategies) and does not contain performance results. No direct evidence found in the manuscript supporting a 44% reduction in standard tracklet-wise i.i.d. settings.
  - Section 5 (Tracklet-wise i.i.d. setup): “Table 2 reports the results…” Evidence: Block #35. Table 2 (Block #21) is an overview of methods, not results. No direct evidence found in the manuscript for the numerical results referenced as “Table 2.”
  - Section 5 (Tracklet-wise non-i.i.d.): “Table 3 presents the results…” Evidence: Block #36. Table 3 (Block #22) lists corruption types, not performance results. No direct evidence found in the manuscript for the numerical results referenced as “Table 3.”
- Conflicting table numbering between main text and appendix:
  - Table 4 is used for “Error rates on all splits of ITD” in the main text (Block #24) and re-used in the appendix for “Effect of Adversarial Memory Initialization… under Dynamic Severity” (Block #60), creating ambiguity.
  - Table 5 appears as CIFAR-10-C comparison in the main text (Block #15), and as “Tracklet-wise non-i.i.d.” ADVMEM vs baselines in the appendix (Block #68), again causing confusion.
Impact: These misreferences and duplications make it impossible to validate several central claimed improvements and undermine trust in the empirical evidence.

2) Numerical inconsistencies regarding ADVMEM improvements
- Main-text claims vs appendix results:
  - Section 5 (non-i.i.d. setup): “ADVMEM enhances RoTTA’s performance by an average of 4%, with specific improvements of 16% and 10% against pixelate and zoom corruptions, respectively.” Evidence: Block #36. Appendix Table 5 (Block #68) shows RoTTA average error changes from 79.3 (✗) to 78.2 (✓), which is a 1.1% absolute improvement, not 4%. Per-corruption:
    - Zoom: 78.9 (✗) → 77.3 (✓) = 1.6% improvement (not 10%).
    - Pixelate: 67.4 (✗) → 67.7 (✓) = −0.3% (a slight degradation, not a 16% improvement).
- Contradiction about TrainMem (initializing memory with training samples):
  - Main text: “this approach does not improve performance” (Block #32).
  - Appendix: “TrainMem … has positive impact in reducing the error rate of RoTTA” with average 75.5 vs 79.3 baseline (Block #59, Table 5 in Block #68).
  - Further, the appendix text asserts “ADVMEM improves over this naive initialization by over 2% against glass blur,” but Table 5 shows glass blur errors: baseline 87.3, ADVMEM 85.6 (−1.7), TrainMem 83.3 (−4.0). ADVMEM underperforms TrainMem on glass blur by 2.3%. Evidence: Block #68.
Impact: These discrepancies directly conflict with claimed benefits of ADVMEM and substantially reduce confidence in the reported improvements.

3) Inconsistent description of experimental scope: “single domain shift” vs evaluation across 15 corruptions
- Overview of Section 4: “Each scenario is tested under a single domain shift (e.g., fog) to isolate the effect of adaptation techniques.” Evidence: Block #19.
- Frame-wise i.i.d.: “assess performance degradation under 15 different corruptions” and Table 5 shows aggregate results across 15 corruptions. Evidence: Blocks #25 and #28; Appendix Table 6 (Block #69) also reports 15 corruptions.
Impact: This contradiction affects the interpretation of the experimental design and what conclusions can be drawn about adaptation to “single” shifts vs aggregated multi-shift evaluations.

4) Method list inconsistency and missing method details
- Number of methods: Section 4.2 states eight TTA methods are evaluated (Block #21), but Table 2 there lists seven (AdaBN, SHOT-IM, TENT, SAR, EATA, CoTTA, RoTTA). ETA appears later in performance tables (Table 5 in Block #28 and Table 6 in Block #69) but is not defined in Table 2 or clearly referenced in the bibliography (ETA is mentioned alongside [35] in Block #10 but [35] is EATA; no separate ETA reference is provided).
Impact: Lack of a defined ETA method (description and citation) prevents verification and replication of those results.

5) ADVMEM algorithm specification gaps that affect correctness and reproducibility
- Algorithm 1 stopping criterion and optimization details:
  - The inner loop continues “while fθ(x) ≠ y” (Block #34), with no maximum iterations, convergence criterion, or guarantees of feasibility. This can lead to non-terminating loops or unstable behavior.
  - Critical hyperparameters (step size α, memory capacity N/K allocation scheme) are not specified in the main text. Evidence: Block #34; no values provided elsewhere.
- Claimed “class-balanced”/“all classes accounted for” vs actual sampling:
  - ADVMEM assigns labels y ∼ U{1,…,K} (Block #34 and #31). Uniform random sampling does not guarantee coverage of all classes nor class balance unless constraints are enforced. The paper claims “prevent forgetting by ensuring all classes are accounted for” and refers to TrainMem as “class-wise balanced … similar to our adversarial one” (Block #31; Block #59), which is not guaranteed by ADVMEM’s random sampling.
Impact: These omissions and overclaims materially affect the correctness and reproducibility of ADVMEM, since initialization behavior (balance and termination) critically influences performance in non-i.i.d. streams.

6) Batch size–tracklet length consistency and missing details
- Appendix states: “default batch size of 64 ensures that exactly one tracklet (64 frames) fits in one forward pass” (Block #56).
- Dataset construction: frames are sampled at 5-frame intervals and resized; no statement that tracklets are standardized to length 64 or how variable-length tracklets are handled to guarantee “exactly one tracklet (64 frames).” Evidence: Block #18; Block #56.
Impact: Without explicit handling of tracklet length standardization, the assertion that batch size 64 corresponds to exactly one tracklet is unclear, affecting the interpretation of batch-wise adaptation and the reported results.

7) Miscellaneous reference inconsistencies
- Duplicate entries in references (same papers listed twice): e.g., [3]/[4], [19]/[20], [46]/[47], [50]/[51]. Evidence: Blocks #46–#54.
Impact: While minor in isolation, these editorial inconsistencies compound the overall clarity issues and may complicate citation tracking.

Additional observations (less critical but noteworthy)

- The sentence “On RoTTA: Category-balanced sampling heuristics.” appears isolated next to Table 5 (Block #28) without explanation of how category-balanced sampling is applied in experiments. This is a missing methodological detail affecting reproducibility.
- The description of RoTTA as “distillation-based” (Block #28) seems imprecise given the earlier emphasis on memory banks (Block #10), but this characterization does not directly impact numerical results.

Conclusion

The manuscript contains several high-impact internal inconsistencies and missing details that undermine the credibility and verifiability of its main empirical claims, particularly those related to ADVMEM’s performance:

- Multiple misreferenced tables make it impossible to confirm headline improvements.
- ADVMEM improvement claims conflict with the appendix’s own reported numbers, especially for RoTTA and specific corruptions (pixelate, zoom, glass blur).
- The stated “single domain shift” evaluation contradicts the use of multi-corruption averages.
- The ADVMEM algorithm lacks essential hyperparameter and stopping details, and its claims of class balance are not supported by the described sampling scheme.
- Method listings are inconsistent (ETA appears in results but is undefined), and tracklet/batch size relationships are insufficiently specified.

Addressing these issues (correct table references, consistent and accurate reporting of numerical results, full algorithmic and hyperparameter disclosure, clear method definitions, and precise experimental setup descriptions) is necessary for the paper’s scientific validity and integrity.
