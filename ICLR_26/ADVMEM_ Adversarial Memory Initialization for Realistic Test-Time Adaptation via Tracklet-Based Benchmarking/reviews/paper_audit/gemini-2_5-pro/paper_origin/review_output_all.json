The visualizations of the generated samples are uninformative noise patterns, which is expected but adds little insight without the accompanying methodological details (Figure 8).4) Suggestions for Improvement\n*   **Revise Manuscript to Improve Clarity and Consolidate Results:** To make the paper's contributions clear and verifiable, the presentation of results should be significantly revised.\n    *   Please proofread the entire manuscript and correct all incorrect table and figure references (e.g., in Section 5).\n    *   I strongly recommend creating a new, comprehensive table in the main paper that replaces or extends Table 6. This table should directly compare the error rates of all relevant methods (TENT, SHOT-IM, RoTTA) *with and without* ADVMEM, across both the tracklet-wise i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings.\n    *   This consolidation would place the core evidence for the paper's primary claims in a single, easy-to-interpret location in the main text.*   **Clarify and Reconcile Contradictory Claims:** The manuscript should be revised to present a consistent narrative about ADVMEM's performance.\n    *   Please clarify the exact conditions under which the \">40% improvement\" for SHOT-IM was achieved. If this result is from the \"dynamic corruption\" setting (Appendix Table 4(a)), this context should be provided upfront when the claim is made in Section 5.\n    *   Please reconcile the claim of a large i.i.d. improvement with the later statement that the method has a \"limited effect\" in i.i.d. settings (Section 6.2). An explanation is needed to clarify if the effect varies by method (e.g., SHOT-IM vs. RoTTA) or by experimental condition (e.g., static vs. dynamic corruptions).*   **Complete and Clarify the Evaluation of ADVMEM:** The evaluation should be expanded to provide a more complete and balanced picture of ADVMEM's utility.\n    *   Please add a table with detailed results for TENT+ADVMEM and SHOT-IM+ADVMEM in the standard tracklet-wise non-i.i.d. scenario to substantiate the claims made in the text (Section 5).\n    *   Include a brief discussion in the analysis section about the scenarios where ADVMEM provides limited gains (e.g., for SHOT-IM/TENT in Appendix Table 4(b)), offering potential hypotheses for this behavior. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the method's scope.\n    *   Briefly justify the choice of integrating RoTTA's memory mechanism into TENT and SHOT-IM, or acknowledge it as one possible implementation choice.*   **Provide Missing Implementation Details for ADVMEM:** To ensure the work is reproducible, please add the necessary details for the adversarial generation process.\n    *   In the appendix or experimental setup section, please specify the hyperparameters used for Algorithm 1: the learning rate `α`, the number of optimization steps per sample, details on the noise distribution, and any value clipping or projection applied to the generated samples `x`.\n    *   Add a sentence or two discussing the one-time computational overhead of running ADVMEM before the test-time adaptation begins.5) Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — The paper introduces a valuable benchmark and a well-motivated method, but the presentation of results and internal consistency need significant improvement (Table 6, Section 5, Section 6.2).\n- Novelty (10): 9 — The ITD benchmark for TTA is highly novel and addresses a key gap, and the ADVMEM initialization strategy is a simple yet clever contribution (Section 1, Section 5.1).\n- Technical Quality (10): 7 — The experimental design is rigorous (Section 4), but the reporting is flawed by contradictory claims, incomplete evaluation, and missing details for reproducibility (Section 5, Section 6.2, Algorithm 1).\n- Clarity (10): 5 — While the high-level ideas are clear, the manuscript is severely hampered by incorrect table references, scattered key results, and contradictory statements, making it very difficult to follow and verify the claims (Section 5, Table 6).\n- Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, having expertise in domain adaptation and robustness, and I have carefully cross-referenced the text with the tables in the main paper and appendix."
