          "strength": "Both reviews strongly align on the primary strength, identifying the ITD benchmark's motivation to address temporal correlations in TTA as a timely and valuable contribution. They also agree that the tracklet-based construction and modular design are sensible and practical strengths of the work.",
          "weakness": "The reviews show low alignment on weaknesses, focusing on different core issues; while both criticize the ADVMEM method as under-analyzed and note presentation issues, Review A's main critiques are the benchmark's lack of novelty and outdated baselines, which Review B does not mention. Conversely, Review B's primary critique is the severe internal contradictions in the quantitative results, a major point absent from Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews show moderate alignment, agreeing on the paper's core strengths but diverging significantly on its primary weaknesses. While both arrive at a similarly negative overall judgment, their rationales differ substantially, with one focusing on conceptual novelty and experimental scope and the other on internal empirical validity and implementation flaws."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core strength as the benchmark's realistic temporal dependencies addressing a gap in TTA evaluation, and both note the simplicity of the proposed ADVMEM method. Review B is more granular, adding secondary strengths like the structured evaluation protocol and architecture analysis, while Review A is more concise.",
          "weakness": "There is very high alignment on weaknesses, with both reviews criticizing the questionable novelty, insufficient baselines, lack of deep analysis for the ADVMEM method, and major reproducibility/documentation gaps. Review B provides more specific, actionable examples for these shared concerns, such as incorrect table references and missing algorithm parameters.",
          "overall": "The overall judgment is highly consistent: both reviews praise the paper's timely motivation and benchmark concept but conclude the execution is flawed due to a lack of rigor, incomplete analysis, and poor presentation. While Review A explicitly states a negative sentiment, Review B implies the same conclusion through its extensive and severe list of weaknesses."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the benchmark (ITD) addresses a real gap in TTA evaluation by introducing temporal correlations via tracklets, and the proposed method (ADVMEM) is simple. Review B provides more granular, evidence-backed points (e.g., citing specific tables), but the high-level substance and prioritization of these strengths are nearly identical to Review A.",
          "weakness": "There is a very high degree of alignment on weaknesses, with both reviews highlighting insufficient/outdated baselines, questionable novelty of the benchmark, the incremental and under-analyzed nature of the ADVMEM method, and major issues with reproducibility and presentation. Review B is more forensic, detailing specific table reference errors and missing hyperparameters, but these points directly support the broader critiques made in Review A.",
          "overall": "The overall judgment is highly consistent: both reviews conclude that the paper has a strong, timely motivation but is severely undermined by flaws in execution, rigor, and clarity. The focus on the benchmark's potential versus its current flawed state is the same, making their substantive message to the authors nearly identical."
