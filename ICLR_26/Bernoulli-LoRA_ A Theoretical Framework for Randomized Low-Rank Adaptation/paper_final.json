      "text": "## Abstract\n\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [Hu et al., 2022] stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity, expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive empirical studies demonstrate LoRA’s practical utility, theoretical understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA [Malinovsky et al., 2024] took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work, we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE, Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant. Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex, non-smooth functions, providing convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes. Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT methods.",

      "text": "1 Introduction\n\nFine-tuning is a transfer learning method, where a pre-trained neural network is trained on a new dataset. In modern deep learning, adapting large models to specific tasks via fine-tuning has become central, especially in natural language processing [Peters et al., 2018, Devlin et al., 2019]. While full fine-tuning often yields strong results, it is computationally intensive for large models. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) [He et al., 2021] addresses this by updating only a small subset of parameters [Richtárik and Takáč, 2016, Demidovich et al., 2023a], often with task-specific layers trained from scratch. PEFT offers performance close to full fine-tuning with reduced training time and resource use [Radford et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Han et al., 2024], making it widely adopted in practice. Research on PEFT, especially for large foundation and language models, is rapidly growing.",

      "text": "Pre-trained models are known to have an inherently low intrinsic dimensionality [Li et al., 2018, Aghajanyan et al., 2020]. This means that fine-tuning can be effectively achieved within a reduced-dimensional subspace rather than the full parameter space. Among the various methods for utilizing this property, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [Hu et al., 2022] stands out as the most prominent reparameterization technique. LoRA minimizes the need to update an entire large, dense weight matrix by leveraging the product of two trainable low-rank matrices. This method significantly reduces the number of parameters required for fine-tuning. The low-rank matrices are optimized so that their scaled product serves as the update applied to the weight matrix:\n\n$$W = W^0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{r}BA$$\n\nwhere $W^0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$, and $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$. The pre-trained weight matrix $W^0$ remains fixed, while $A$ and $B$ are the trainable matrices. Typically, $A$ is initialized randomly using a Gaussian distribution, while $B$ is set to zero to ensure that $\\Delta W = 0$ at the start. Various alternative initialization strategies have been investigated by [Zhu et al., 2024, Hayou et al., 2024, Meng et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2024].\n\nThe parameters of LoRA include the low rank $r$ and the scaling factor $\\alpha$. Since the dimensions $m$ and $n$ in deep learning models are usually large, selecting $r \\ll \\min\\{m, n\\}$ drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters. The scaling factor $\\alpha$ acts as the stepsize. While LoRA may not always achieve the performance of full fine-tuning, it is more effective at mitigating forgetting when compared to traditional regularization techniques like weight decay and dropout. Additionally, it enhances diversity in generated outputs [Biderman et al., 2024]. Furthermore, LoRA is straightforward to implement and achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning across a wide range of downstream tasks [Hu et al., 2022]. Complementing its algorithmic utility, research has also focused on enhancing the computational efficiency of LoRA; for instance, Cherniuk et al. [2023] demonstrated that by optimizing the computation graph of LoRA operations based on layer dimensions and rank, significant speedups and memory savings can be achieved without sacrificing accuracy. For a detailed summary of recent advancements in LoRA, refer to [Mao et al., 2025].\n\nTo bridge the gap between full fine-tuning and LoRA, Xia et al. [2024] introduced Chain of LoRA (COLA), an iterative optimization framework that enhances model weights via higher-rank representations composed of multiple low-rank components—without added computational or memory cost. COLA incrementally refines low-rank approximations by training a sequence of LoRA modules through structured fine-tuning, merging, and extension. Each iteration adds a new low-rank component, forming a chain whose length reflects the number of optimized modules. The core idea involves applying LoRA updates iteratively over $T$ steps: training a module, integrating its updates into fixed parameters, re-initializing, and repeating. This cyclic process builds higher-rank augmentations efficiently. In essence, COLA applies successive LoRA updates as:\n\n$$W = W^0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{r} \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} B^t A^t$$\n\nEach pair $(A^t, B^t)$ is initialized like standard LoRA. Unlike traditional LoRA, which may struggle with non-low-rank adaptations, COLA uses sequential low-rank decompositions to approximate updates of intermediate-to-high rank. This leads to more accurate and efficient adaptation while simplifying optimization by avoiding a direct high-rank fit.",

Several critical issues highlight this gap. Firstly, as pointed out by Sun et al. [2024], the LoRA re-parameterization inherently transforms a smooth Lipschitz loss into a non-smooth one. This alteration introduces significant theoretical complexities beyond those associated with managing the low-rank structure of updates, forming a key barrier to establishing robust theoretical frameworks.

      "text": "The core mechanism of low-rank updates by focusing on full-rank matrix optimization (ΔW). Such an approach is unsatisfactory as it fails to model or explain the very essence of LoRA’s efficiency.\n\nConsequently, most methods based on LoRA are, in essence, heuristics, developed through empirical investigation without strong theoretical convergence guarantees. This is problematic, as these methods can be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices [Khodak et al., 2021, Kuang et al., 2024], and their reliability beyond current empirical validation is not assured. In fact, Malinovsky et al. [2024] provided a concrete example of COLA’s potential divergence, further underscoring its heuristic nature. Their work introduced RAC-LoRA, the first comprehensive optimization framework designed to rigorously evaluate and establish convergence rates for methods utilizing LoRA-style updates, marking a significant step towards theoretically grounded PEFT.\n\nHowever, while RAC-LoRA provides a foundational theoretical lens, its scope does not encompass several critical aspects of modern optimization, particularly for non-convex problems and distributed settings. Specifically, the RAC-LoRA framework does not utilize optimal variance-reduced techniques for non-convex optimization, nor does it delve into sophisticated Federated Learning (FL) settings that incorporate crucial practical techniques such as communication compression [Alistarh et al., 2018, Wen et al., 2017, Horváth et al., 2022, Panferov et al., 2024] and error feedback. Federated learning [Konečný et al., 2016, Konečný et al., 2016, McMahan et al., 2016, Kairouz et al., 2019] is a decentralized paradigm where multiple clients collaboratively train a model on their local, private data. The growing demand for training massive deep neural networks with billions of parameters on vast datasets [Brown et al., 2020, Kolesnikov et al., 2020] has intensified the ML community’s interest in distributed optimization. To achieve feasible training times [Li, 2020], distributing computation, especially stochastic gradient evaluations, is essential, driving the adoption of scalable algorithms [Goyal et al., 2017, You et al., 2019, Le Scao et al., 2023]. Our work is motivated by the need to bridge this gap by extending a theoretically sound LoRA framework to these advanced and practically vital optimization scenarios.",

While recent work by Malinovsky et al. [2024] on RAC-LoRA provided initial steps towards a rigorous analytical framework, we aim to further advance the theoretical foundations and practical versatility of low-rank adaptation techniques.\n\nIn PEFT approaches based on low-rank adaptation, two matrices, A and B, are typically updated. Existing methods may update only A, only B, or alternate between them deterministically [Malinovsky et al., 2024, Xia et al., 2024, Zhu et al., 2024]. Our primary contribution is the introduction of Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel and generic low-rank adaptation framework. Bernoulli-LoRA is characterized by its unique probabilistic update mechanism: at each step of the adaptation process, a Bernoulli trial (akin to a coin flip) determines which of the two matrices (A or B) is selected for optimization, while the other matrix is sampled from a predefined distribution and remains fixed for that step. This randomized selection not only provides a flexible approach but also unifies and generalizes several existing update strategies within a single theoretical construct. Much like the iterative design of COLA [Xia et al., 2024], the Bernoulli-LoRA framework operates by applying a sequence of such probabilistically chosen low-rank updates.\n\nOur theoretical analysis is grounded in standard assumptions common in non-convex optimization literature, such as L-smoothness of the objective function. We instantiate the Bernoulli-LoRA framework by developing and analyzing several distinct algorithmic variants. These variants span a range of optimization techniques, from foundational gradient-based methods to more advanced stochastic, variance-reduced, and federated learning algorithms, each designed to address specific challenges in modern machine learning. For every proposed method within the Bernoulli-LoRA framework, we establish rigorous convergence guarantees. Our key contributions, which advance the theoretical understanding",

The core idea is to perform a sequence of low-rank updates, where at each step, a probabilistic choice determines which of the two factor matrices (A or B) is trained. This randomized mechanism, formalized in Algorithm 1, not only provides a flexible and unifying theoretical construct for existing LoRA-style methods but also allows for a rigorous convergence analysis.\n\nAt each iteration, one of the two low-rank matrices is sampled from a fixed distribution and remains frozen, while the other is trained to minimize the objective. This strategy prevents optimization from being confined to a fixed subspace, reducing the risk of converging to a suboptimal point. We formalize these two configurations as Left and Right sketch updates.\n\nDefinition 1 (Left Sketch).

We use (~) for pre-training quantities and (^) for fine-tuning. During the pre-training phase, we solve\n\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} \\left\\{ \\tilde{f}(x) := \\frac{1}{2\\tilde{m}} \\left\\| \\tilde{D}x - \\tilde{b} \\right\\|_2^2 + \\tilde{\\lambda} \\sum_{j=1}^d \\frac{x_j^2}{1 + x_j^2} \\right\\},\n$$\n(11)\n\nwhere $\\tilde{D} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{m} \\times n}$, $\\tilde{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{m}}$, $\\tilde{m} = 9 \\times 10^4$, and $n = 4096$. We set $\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\left\\| \\tilde{D} \\right\\|_2 \\approx 18.2$, giving $\\tilde{L} \\approx 54.7$. We optimize until $\\|\\nabla \\tilde{f}(\\tilde{x}^*)\\|^2 \\le 10^{-8}$ to obtain $\\tilde{x}^*$. For the fine-tuning phase, we use $\\tilde{x}^*$ as the initialization and then solve\n\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} \\left\\{ \\hat{f}(x) := \\frac{1}{2\\hat{m}} \\left\\| \\hat{D}x - \\hat{b} \\right\\|_2^2 + \\hat{\\lambda} \\sum_{j=1}^d \\frac{x_j^2}{1 + x_j^2} \\right\\},\n$$\n(12)\n\nwhere $\\hat{D} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\hat{m} \\times n}$, $\\hat{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\hat{m}}$, and $\\hat{m} = 10^4$. We keep $n = 4096$ and set $\\hat{\\lambda} = \\left\\| \\hat{D} \\right\\|_2 \\approx 4101.7$, yielding $\\hat{L} \\approx 12305.3$. This second phase uses a dataset with notably different characteristics to mirror realistic domain shifts.\n\nStochastic setting. We consider the stochastic setting, comparing RAC-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, and Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE. In all experiments, we use a batch size of 100, which corresponds to 1% of the data.\n\n| ![Graph showing comparison of RAC-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD and Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE on linear regression fine-tuning. The x-axis shows Data passes from 0 to 200, and the y-axis shows \\|\\nabla f(x)\\|^2 on a logarithmic scale from 10^{-15} to 10^3. Four curves are shown: Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE (p=0.5) in red with star markers, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD (p=0.5) in orange with inverted triangle markers, RAC-LoRA-SGD (A) in brown with left-pointing triangle markers, and RAC-LoRA-SGD (B) in green with right-pointing triangle markers. The Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE curve shows the steepest descent, dropping from 10^3 to below 10^{-15}, while the other three curves plateau around 10^0 to 10^3.](figure1) |\n| --- |\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of RAC-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD and Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE on linear regression fine-tuning. Curves with $p = 0.01, 0.2, \\ldots$ indicate Bernoulli-LoRA sampling parameters. RAC-LoRA-SGD (A) trains $B$ after resampling $A$, while RAC-LoRA-SGD (B) does the reverse. All methods use $\\gamma = c/\\hat{L}$ with $c$ tuned individually.\n\nFigure 1 shows that Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE successfully reduces variance and converges to the target tolerance, whereas all SGD variants stall at a certain accuracy. This underscores the practical advantage of Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE over the baseline RAC-LoRA-SGD in the stochastic setting from an optimization standpoint.",

      "text": "## 8.2 MLP on MNIST\n\nIn this section, we evaluate Bernoulli-LoRA against established baselines in parameter-efficient fine-tuning, following the setup of Malinovsky et al. [2024]. Source code of our experiments is available at https://github.com/IgorSokoloff/Bernoulli-LoRA_experiments.\n\nMethodology. We first pre-train a three-layer MLP on MNIST digits 0–4 [LeCun et al., 1998], then adapt it with various LoRA-type methods to classify digits 5–9. Only unseen classes are used for evaluation. All adaptations use rank r = 1 and train for 50 epochs with AdamW [Loshchilov, 2017] (β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, ε = 10^{-8}), a fixed learning rate of 2 × 10^{-4}, and batch size 128. Each method is run 20 times using different seeds, and Table 3 reports the median accuracy (with standard deviation). For Bernoulli-LoRA, we show the best median accuracy among all tested settings.\n\n| Method           | 𝒟_A             | 𝒟_B             | Acc. (test)  | Train Params |\n| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------ |\n| FPFT             | -                | -                | 99.5         | 54,700       |\n| LoRA             | Gaussian         | Zero             | 85.69 ± 1.60 | 1K           |\n| LoRA             | Zero             | Gaussian         | 89.82 ± 0.90 | 1K           |\n| COLA             | Gaussian         | Zero             | 93.32 ± 0.50 | 1K           |\n| COLA             | Zero             | Gaussian         | 96.55 ± 0.20 | 1K           |\n| AsymmLoRA        | Gaussian         | Zero             | 64.04 ± 6.90 | 133          |\n| AsymmLoRA        | Zero             | Gaussian         | 74.52 ± 7.20 | 912          |\n| RAC-LoRA         | Gaussian         | Zero             | 93.02 ± 0.50 | 133          |\n| RAC-LoRA         | Zero             | Gaussian         | 96.49 ± 0.20 | 912          |\n| Bernoulli-LoRA^2 | Zero^1           | Gaussian         | 96.46 ± 0.17 | ≈ 904        |\n\n^1 Although Bernoulli-LoRA prescribes probabilistic selection from the first iteration, a deterministic assignment of fixed and trainable matrices at initialization yielded better performance.\n\n^2 Achieved with p = 0.99, giving an expected trainable parameter count p·912 + (1 − p)·133 ≈ 904. Here, 912 and 133 are the parameter counts for matrices A and B, respectively.\n\nTable 3: Performance on MNIST classification using an MLP with rank r and scaling α = 1. For AsymmLoRA and RAC-LoRA, only the zero-initialized matrix is trained.\n\nDiscussion. From Table 3, standard LoRA attains roughly 86% of full-parameter fine-tuning (FPFT) accuracy, indicating room for improvements via chaining. COLA improves upon vanilla LoRA, though both lack formal convergence guarantees. AsymmLoRA approximates LoRA in practice [Sun et al., 2024] but similarly lacks convergence analysis, whereas RAC-LoRA and Bernoulli-LoRA both boost accuracy and have theoretical backing. Notably, Bernoulli-LoRA matches RAC-LoRA in generalization and also guarantees convergence. An additional benefit is that RAC-LoRA and Bernoulli-LoRA each train only one matrix per LoRA block, whereas COLA needs two. In RAC-LoRA, either A or B is trained deterministically; in Bernoulli-LoRA, the choice is probabilistic, yielding an expected pmr + (1 − p)rn trainable parameters. This advantage is especially valuable in resource-constrained settings such as Federated Learning.\n\nDetailed configurations, hardware specs, and dataset descriptions are provided in Appendix E.",

      "text": "B Discussion on Positive Expected Projection (Assumption 1)\n\nAssumption 1 merits further discussion. While any single projection matrix has eigenvalues that are either 0 or 1 (with the smallest being 0), the expected value of a random projection matrix can have all its eigenvalues strictly greater than zero. This property is crucial for ensuring stable convergence behavior in our framework.\n\nLater in this section, we will utilize the following lemma, which is a classical result from linear algebra, often known as a direct consequence of Schur’s Lemma [Hall, 2013, Schur, 2024].\n\nLemma 1 (Rotational Invariance Implies Scalar Matrix). Let M ∈ ℝ^{n×n} be a matrix satisfying\nM = QMQ^\\top for all orthonormal matrices Q ∈ ℝ^{n×n}. (17)\nThen M = α I_n for some scalar α ∈ ℝ.\n\nProof. The condition M = QMQ^\\top is equivalent to MQ = QM, which means that M commutes with every orthonormal matrix Q. Since M is a real symmetric matrix, it is guaranteed to have at least one real eigenvector. Let v be such an eigenvector with corresponding eigenvalue λ. We can normalize this eigenvector to create a unit vector u₁ = v/∥v∥, which is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue:\nMu₁ = M(v/∥v∥) = (1/∥v∥)Mv = (1/∥v∥)(λv) = λ(v/∥v∥) = λu₁.\n\nNow, let u be any other arbitrary unit vector in ℝ^n. Because both u₁ and u are unit vectors (i.e., they lie on the unit sphere), there always exists an orthonormal matrix Q (specifically, a rotation) that maps u₁ to u. That is, u = Qu₁.\n\nWe now examine the action of M on this arbitrary unit vector u:\nMu = M(Qu₁) = (MQ)u₁ = (QM)u₁ = Q(Mu₁) = Q(λu₁) = λ(Qu₁) = λu.\n\nWe have shown that any arbitrary unit vector u is an eigenvector of M with the same eigenvalue λ. If every unit vector is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ, then for any non-zero vector x ∈ ℝ^n, we can write x = ∥x∥ · (x/∥x∥). Let u_x := x/∥x∥ be the corresponding unit vector. Then:\nMx = M(∥x∥u_x) = ∥x∥(Mu_x) = ∥x∥(λu_x) = λ(∥x∥u_x) = λx.\n\nSince Mx = λx for all vectors x ∈ ℝ^n, the matrix M must be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, i.e., M = λI_n. □\n\nIn practice, LoRA-type methods often employ Gaussian sampling for the matrices A_S or B_S [Xia et al., 2024, Mao et al., 2025]. The following lemma, a standard result in multivariate statistics, demonstrates that under such Gaussian sampling, Assumption 1 is naturally satisfied.\n\nLemma 2 (Expected Eigenvalues of Random Projection Matrices). Consider a projection matrix H_B generated by a random matrix B ∈ ℝ^{n×r} whose entries are i.i.d. 𝒩(0,1) with r < n, defined as:\nH_B = B(B^\\top B)^\\dagger B^\\top,\nwhere † denotes the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse. Similarly, for a random matrix A ∈ ℝ^{r×n} with i.i.d. 𝒩(0,1) entries, we define:\nH_A = A^\\top(AA^\\top)^\\dagger A.",

We will prove the result for $H_B$; the argument for $H_A$ is analogous.\n\nFirst, we establish that $\\mathbb{E}[H_B]$ must be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Let $Q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ be an arbitrary orthonormal matrix. Due to the rotational invariance of the multivariate standard normal distribution, the random matrix $QB$ has the same distribution as $B$.\n\nConsider the projection matrix $H_{QB}$ generated by $QB$:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_{QB}\n&=(QB)\\bigl((QB)^\\top QB\\bigr)^\\dagger (QB)^\\top\\\\\n&=QB\\bigl(B^\\top Q^\\top QB\\bigr)^\\dagger B^\\top Q^\\top\\\\\n&=QB\\bigl(B^\\top B\\bigr)^\\dagger B^\\top Q^\\top\\\\\n&=Q\\bigl(B(B^\\top B)^\\dagger B^\\top\\bigr)Q^\\top\n=QH_BQ^\\top.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince $QB$ and $B$ are identically distributed, their expectations must be equal: $\\mathbb{E}[H_{QB}]=\\mathbb{E}[H_B]$.

By Lemma 1, $\\mathbb{E}[H_B]$ must be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, so $\\mathbb{E}[H_B]=\\alpha I_n$ for some scalar $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo determine this scalar, we use the property that the trace of a projection matrix is equal to its rank. Since the columns of $B$ are drawn from a continuous distribution, they are linearly independent almost surely (as $r\\le n$). Thus, the rank of $H_B$ is $r$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Tr}(H_B)]=\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{rank}(H_B)]=r.$$\nBy linearity of expectation and trace, we also have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Tr}(H_B)]=\\operatorname{Tr}(\\mathbb{E}[H_B])=\\operatorname{Tr}(\\alpha I_n)=\\alpha n.$$\nEquating the two expressions gives $\\alpha n=r$, which implies $\\alpha=\\frac{r}{n}$. Therefore,\n$$\\mathbb{E}[H_B]=\\frac{r}{n}I_n.$$\n\nThe same argument applies to $H_A$ by observing that $A^\\top$ is an $n\\times r$ matrix with i.i.d. $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ entries, which completes the proof. □",

Reddi et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2018; Malinovsky et al., 2022; Richtárik et al., 2024]. It has gained prominence as a formidable alternative to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in tackling non-convex optimization problems. Notably, it has been pivotal in introducing the first algorithms capable of surpassing SGD’s convergence rate for locating first-order critical points. Despite these advancements, variance reduction methods often come with challenges, including the necessity for meticulously tuned learning rates and the reliance on overly large batch sizes to realize their benefits. To address some of these limitations, Momentum Variance Reduction (MVR) was proposed specifically for server-only stochastic non-convex optimization [Cutkosky and Orabona, 2019]. This approach leverages a modified form of momentum to achieve variance reduction while eliminating the dependence on large batch sizes. A proof on the MVR technique with better dependence on the momentum parameter was obtained by Tyurin and Richtárik [2023]. In the context of Federated Learning, Karagulyan et al. [2024] proposed the SPAM method. On the server side, MVR is utilized to enhance optimization efficiency, while the client side incorporates the Stochastic Proximal Point Method updates. This section is devoted to Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, a method designed in the scope of the Bernoulli-LoRA framework, based on the MVR technique.\n\nTo show convergence guarantees for Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, the iterates of the method can be rewritten in the following way:\n\nW^{t+1} = W^t − γ Ĝ^t, where Ĝ^t = { H_B^t G^t, with probability p; G^t H_A^t, with probability 1 − p } (100)\n\nG^{t+1} = ∇f_{ξ^{t+1}}(W^{t+1}) + (1 − b)(G^t − ∇f_{ξ^{t+1}}(W^t)).

However, the known lower bound used to establish their optimality works only in the small-data regime. Probabilistic Gradient Estimator (PAGE) [Li et al., 2021] is a very simple and easy-to-implement algorithm, known for achieving optimal convergence results in non-convex optimization. PAGE uses the full gradient update with probability $q_t$, or reuses the previous gradient with a small adjustment (at a low computational cost) with probability $1 - q_t$. A general version of PAGE on Riemannian manifolds is considered in [Demidovich et al., 2024a]. In this section we present Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE, a new method within the Bernoulli-LoRA framework, based on the PAGE algorithm.\n\nNotice that the iterates of Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE (Algorithm 6) can be rewritten in the following simple way\n$$\nW^{t+1} = W^t - \\gamma \\hat{G}^t, \\quad \\text{where } \\hat{G}^t =\n\\begin{cases}\nH_B^t G^t, & \\text{with probability } p \\\\\nG^t H_A^t, & \\text{with probability } 1 - p\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{109}\n$$\n$$\nG^{t+1} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\nabla f(W^{t+1}), & \\text{with probability } q \\\\\nG^t + \\left(\\nabla f_{i_{t+1}}(W^{t+1}) - \\nabla f_{i_{t+1}}(W^t)\\right), & \\text{with probability } 1 - q\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{110}\n$$\n\nLemma 7.

This surge in interest is driven by the need to train modern deep neural networks, which often involve billions of parameters and massive datasets [Brown et al., 2020; Kolesnikov et al., 2020]. To achieve practical training times [Li, 2020], parallelizing computations, such as stochastic gradient evaluations, has emerged as a natural solution, leading to the widespread adoption of distributed training algorithms [Goyal et al., 2017; You et al., 2019; Le Scao et al., 2023]. Additionally, distributed methods are crucial when data is inherently distributed across multiple devices or clients, often accompanied by privacy constraints—a common scenario in Federated Learning (FL) [Konečný et al., 2016; McMahan et al., 2016; Kairouz et al., 2019; Demidovich et al., 2024b; Sadiev et al., 2024; Yi et al., 2024].\n\nParallel implementations of SGD have become a prominent area of study due to their impressive scalability. However, one of the primary challenges in parallelizing SGD lies in the substantial communication overhead required to exchange gradient updates across nodes. To address this, numerous lossy compression techniques have been developed, enabling nodes to transmit quantized gradients instead of full gradients. While these methods often work well in practice, they are not universally reliable and may fail to ensure convergence.\n\nWe develop several FL methods within the Bernoulli-LoRA framework and provide a convergence analysis for them.",

By adjusting the number of bits transmitted per iteration, nodes can reduce bandwidth usage, albeit at the potential cost of increased variance in the gradient estimates.
