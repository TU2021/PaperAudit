Summary of high-impact issues identified

1) Systematic mismatch between main-text theorems and appendix theorems on stepsize conditions
- Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD:
  - Main text Theorem 2 states 0 < γ ≤ min{ 1/(√(L A1 λmax^p) T), (1/(L B1))·(λmax^p/λmin^p)^{-1} } (Block 35).
  - Appendix Theorem 11 states 0 < γ ≤ min{ 1/√(L A1 λmax^p T), 1/(L B1)(λmax^p/λmin^p)^{-1} } (Block 91).
  - The first bound differs materially: main text has 1/(√(L A1 λmax^p) T) while appendix has 1/√(L A1 λmax^p T). The presence of T outside vs. inside the square root changes stepsize scaling by √T, not an “absolute constant,” and affects validity of derived rates.

- Fed-Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD:
  - Main text Theorem 5: 0 < γ ≤ min{ 1/(L√(ω/M) λmax^p T), (1/L)(λmax^p/λmin^p)^{-1} } (Block 38).
  - Appendix Theorem 17: 0 < γ ≤ min{ 1/(L √((ω/M) λmax^p T)), (1/L)(λmax^p/λmin^p)^{-1} } (Block 117).
  - Again, main text places λmax^p T multiplicatively outside the square root, whereas the appendix includes them inside √(·). This is a nontrivial discrepancy.

- Fed-Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA:
  - Main text Theorem 6: 0 < γ ≤ 1/(L(1 + √((1/λmax^p) · ((1−q)/q) · (ω/M)))) (Block 38).
  - Appendix Theorem 19: 0 < γ ≤ 1/(L(1 + √(λmax^p · (1−q)/q · ω/M))) (Block 121).
  - The λmax^p factor is inverted in the main text (1/λmax^p). This changes the permissible stepsize, not covered by omitted constants.

- Fed-Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21:
  - Main text Theorem 7: 0 < γ ≤ 1/(L(1 + √(λmax^p(1−β)/(1−√(1−β))))) (Block 38).
  - Appendix Theorem 21 and the subsequent selection in the proof introduce different constants, including √2 factors in the denominator bound (Blocks 129–130). While some constant differences may be acceptable, the structured discrepancy in the bound’s form suggests lack of internal alignment.

Impact: Stepsize constraints directly govern convergence guarantees. The above inconsistencies materially affect whether the stated rates can actually be achieved under the claimed conditions.

2) Table 1 convergence rates do not match the detailed theorems (variance terms and dependence on λmax^p/λmin^p)
- Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE:
  - Table 1 (Block 16) nonconvex rate: Φ2/(γ λmin T), where Φ2 := Δ0 + (γ/q) 𝒢0. No λmax/λmin factor multiplying the 𝒢0 term.
  - Main text Theorem 4: E[||∇f(Ẇ^T)||^2] ≤ 2Δ0/(γ λmin^p T) + (𝒢0/(qT))·(λmax^p/λmin^p) (Block 37).
  - Missing λmax^p/λmin^p in Table 1’s 𝒢0-term; this is not an absolute constant omission.

- Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR:
  - Table 1 (Block 16) nonconvex rate: Φ1/(γ λmin T) + b σ^2 λmax/((2−b) λmin), with Φ1 := Δ0 + (b γ/(2−b)) 𝒢0.
  - Main text Theorem 3: E[||∇f(Ẇ^T)||^2] ≤ 2Δ0/(γ λmin^p T) + (𝒢0/(bT) + 2bσ^2/(2 − b))·(λmax^p/λmin^p) (Block 36).
  - The coefficient in front of 𝒢0/T differs (Table: b/(2−b)/λmin; Theorem: (1/b)·(λmax/λmin)). The λmax/λmin dependence is missing in Table 1’s Φ1 term.

- Fed-Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21:
  - Table 1: Φ3/(γ λmin T) with Φ3 := Δ0 + γ/(1−√(1−β)) 𝒢0 (Block 16), no λmax/λmin factor on the 𝒢0 term.
  - Appendix Theorem 21: E[||∇f(Ẇ^T)||^2] ≤ 2Δ0/(γ λmin^p T) + (𝒢0/((1−√(1−β)) T)) · (λmax^p/λmin^p) (Block 129–130).
  - Again, Table 1 omits λmax^p/λmin^p in the variance term.

Impact: Table 1 is presented as a summary of main results. Discrepancies in dependence on λmax^p/λmin^p and nonconstant coefficients (in b, q) can mislead readers about the true rates and conditions.

3) Left/Right sketch selection inconsistent across algorithms
- Algorithm 1: “if c^t = 1 then Left sketch” (Lines 4–7) (Block 18).
- Algorithm 3 (non-smooth setting): “If c^t = 1 then (Right sketch)” (Lines 4–7) (Block 74).
Impact: This inversion of the Bernoulli branch condition creates a clear internal contradiction. While proofs rely on generic projections H_A, H_B, algorithmic reproducibility and clarity are materially affected.

4) Incorrect index set in PAGE sampling
- Algorithm 6 (Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE): “Sample i_{t+1} uniformly at random from [n]” (Step 13) (Block 104).
- The finite-sum setting is defined over N samples (Equation (2), Block 8). The index should be from [N].
Impact: This is a concrete, nontrivial notation/definition error that can invalidate the algorithm specification for the finite-sum case.

5) Broken or incorrect equation reference in EF21 lemma
- Lemma 10 proof cites “(130),(131)” (Block 128), but only (130) is defined before; there is no (131) in that vicinity.
Impact: Referencing a non-existent equation undermines traceability of the proof steps.

6) Mislabeling in the appendix text
- In Appendix C.1, immediately before Theorem 1, the text states: “we can now state our main convergence result for RAC-LoRA with Gradient Descent updates” (Block 64), while the theorem is for Bernoulli-LoRA-GD.
Impact: This is an internal inconsistency indicating copy/paste artifacts that reduce trust in carefulness of derivations and exposition.

7) Missing promised experimental details for MNIST
- Main text claims: “Detailed configurations, hardware specs, and dataset descriptions are provided in Appendix E.” for MNIST (Block 43).
- Appendix E only provides details for the linear regression experiments (Blocks 133–139). No MNIST-specific configurations, preprocessing, architecture, or hyperparameter ranges are given.
Impact: The lack of promised MNIST experimental details materially affects reproducibility and verification of empirical claims.

8) Citation inconsistency
- Appendix B cites “[Hall, 2013, Schur, 2024]” for Schur’s Lemma (Block 55).
- The references list has “Issai Schur. … 1905.” (Block 51); no “Schur, 2024” entry.
Impact: This is a concrete bibliographic mismatch; while minor, it signals oversight in citation management.

Additional observations (lower impact)
- Table/Figure caption misalignment: Figure 1 caption claims “Curves with p = 0.01, 0.2, … indicate Bernoulli-LoRA sampling parameters” (Block 41), but the legend visible shows only p = 0.5 for the Bernoulli variants (Block 42). This seems presentational and does not affect the theoretical claims.

Conclusion
The manuscript exhibits several high-impact internal inconsistencies:

- Stepsize conditions in the main text theorems do not align with those in the appendix for key algorithms (SGD, QGD, MARINA, EF21).
- Table 1’s summarized nonconvex rates omit critical dependence on λmax^p/λmin^p present in the detailed theorems, and mismatch the coefficients of variance terms.
- Core algorithm definitions (Left vs. Right sketch selection) are inconsistent across sections.
- Algorithmic indices (PAGE) and equation references (EF21) contain errors.
- Promised MNIST experimental details are missing from the appendix.

These issues materially affect the paper’s correctness, interpretability, and reproducibility. Resolving them would significantly improve scientific integrity. If addressed, no further clear integrity-related problems were identified in the remaining content.
