However, Review B identifies numerous specific internal inconsistencies and errors (e.g., mismatched theorems) that Review A misses, while Review A raises a conceptual point about pre-training that B omits.",
          "overall": "The reviews converge on a similar overall judgment: a theoretically broad paper with questionable novelty and practical impact due to weak experiments. They align strongly on the paper's strengths and high-level weaknesses, but diverge significantly on its technical polish, as Review B finds many concrete errors that Review A misses."
