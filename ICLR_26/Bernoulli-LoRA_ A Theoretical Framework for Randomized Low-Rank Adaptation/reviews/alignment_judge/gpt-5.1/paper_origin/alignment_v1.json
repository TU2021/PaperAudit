    "explanation": {
      "strength": "Both reviews clearly agree on the main goals and positive aspects of the paper. They both (i) identify Bernoulli-LoRA as a unified, probabilistic mechanism for choosing which LoRA factor to update; (ii) emphasize the projected-gradient interpretation as the key conceptual simplification; (iii) highlight the broad, rigorous convergence analysis across GD/SGD/variance-reduced and federated/compressed variants; (iv) acknowledge the extension to non-smooth convex objectives and Polyak-type step-sizes; and (v) see the experiments as small-scale but generally consistent with the theory. Review B goes into more technical detail and is more enthusiastic about novelty, but the core contributions and strengths it highlights match those in Review A. Hence, motivation/strength alignment is high, though not perfect because A is more ambivalent about the contribution’s distinctiveness relative to RAC-LoRA, while B emphasizes its theoretical novelty more strongly.",
      "weakness": "There is partial but weaker alignment on weaknesses. The strongest overlap is on the empirical side: both see the experiments as limited in scope (small synthetic/MNIST tasks, no large-scale or federated experiments) and therefore insufficient to demonstrate practical impact. Beyond that, the foci diverge. Review A stresses (1) questionable novelty versus RAC-LoRA/other asymmetric LoRA schemes; (2) idealized and possibly unrealistic assumptions for deep LoRA fine-tuning; (3) oversimplified modeling of practical multi-layer LoRA; (4) missing related work on LoRA optimization dynamics; (5) broader conceptual criticism about ignoring the role of pretraining. Review B instead focuses on (1) missing, explicit independence assumptions in the proofs; (2) restrictiveness of specific technical assumptions (E[H] = αI) for non-Gaussian sketches; (3) the gap between the strict Bernoulli mechanism and its relaxed practical implementation; and (4) minor notation/numbering issues. It does not raise the same concerns about novelty relative to RAC-LoRA, realism of assumptions for deep networks, or missing pretraining/fine-tuning perspective. Because they overlap mostly on ‘limited empirical validation’ and some minor presentation issues, but differ on the main conceptual/theoretical criticisms, weakness alignment is moderate to low.",
      "overall": "In aggregate, the two reviews are aligned on what the paper is about and on the fact that it offers a broad, technically solid convergence framework with limited empirical validation. They share a view that the projected-gradient formulation and the unification of multiple variants are central contributions, and that the experiments are not sufficient to establish practical impact. However, they diverge meaningfully in judgment about novelty and in which shortcomings are most salient. Review A is skeptical about originality relative to prior RAC-LoRA-style methods and about the realism and relevance of the assumptions and modeling choices for actual LoRA fine-tuning in deep networks, and it also flags broader conceptual issues (pretraining, multi-layer structure, missing related LoRA theory). Review B instead largely accepts the novelty claim within LoRA theory, concentrates on internal technical caveats (independence assumptions, strength of certain spectral assumptions), and only lightly touches on broader conceptual or modeling realism issues. Thus, while there is good agreement on core contributions and on the empirical limitations, the differing emphasis and stance on theoretical/practical novelty and assumptions lead to only moderate overall alignment."

        "overall_alignment": 0.78,
        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews agree that the core contribution is a Bernoulli-style, projected-gradient framework for LoRA/PEFT that unifies many variants (GD, SGD, variance-reduced, and federated/compressed methods) and proves broad convergence guarantees under standard smooth/PŁ/non-smooth convex assumptions, with simple factor-updating mechanics and small experiments that qualitatively match the theory. Review B gives much more granular technical praise (e.g., projection matrices, eigenvalue formulations, non-smooth convex extension, notation), but these details are consistent with and essentially refine the strengths listed in Review A rather than introducing conflicting emphases.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews flag the empirical section as limited/toy and note a mismatch to realistic large-scale PEFT and to the more advanced federated variants that lack experiments, and both question the realism or strength of some assumptions for practical LoRA usage. Review A emphasizes novelty concerns vis-à-vis RAC-LoRA/COLA and broader conceptual gaps (multi-layer LoRA, role of pretraining, missing related LoRA optimization work, notation/presentation issues), whereas Review B focuses more on missing or implicit technical assumptions (independence), practical guidance for parameters (p, sketches, T), and only briefly touches the RAC-LoRA/COLA comparison, so several of A’s conceptual/theoretical-novelty criticisms are underrepresented.",
          "overall": "Substantively, both reviews view the paper as technically solid, broad in its theoretical coverage, and empirically underpowered, and they share a broadly positive but qualified overall judgment. Alignment is high on the central contribution and the main empirical/theoretical-practical gap, with divergence mainly in the depth of novelty critique and in some higher-level conceptual concerns that appear only in the human review. Thus, the reviews are largely consistent in focus and assessment, with Review B offering a more technical, implementation-oriented lens and Review A adding more positioning and conceptual critique."
