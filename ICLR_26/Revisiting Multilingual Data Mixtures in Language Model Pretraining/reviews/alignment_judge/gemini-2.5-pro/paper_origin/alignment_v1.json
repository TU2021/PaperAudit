          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions, praising the paper for its innovative analysis that challenges assumptions about multilingual pretraining, its rigorous experimental design, and its practical guidance. Review B provides more specific examples of the strong methodology (e.g., controlled-growth analysis), but the highlighted strengths are substantively the same as in Review A.",
          "weakness": "There is partial overlap, as both reviews critique the limited scope of the pivot language experiments and the potential for tokenizer bias. However, Review B identifies several major, specific flaws completely missed by Review A, including a taxonomy error in the pivot study, reproducibility gaps in the learning rate schedule, and low sensitivity of evaluation metrics.",
          "overall": "The reviews align well on the paper's strengths and positive contributions, but diverge significantly in their critiques. Review A offers more general weaknesses, while Review B provides a much more detailed and technical fault analysis, identifying several concrete errors. This results in a moderate overall alignment, as their final judgments are based on substantially different sets of identified flaws."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions, namely challenging the \"curse of multilinguality\" through large-scale experiments, and agree that the paper's innovative analysis and relevance are major strengths; Review B simply provides a more granular breakdown of these points.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on two key weaknesses: the use of a single tokenizer and the limited scope of the pivot language experiments. However, they diverge significantly elsewhere, as Review B identifies multiple methodological confounds and reporting errors missed by Review A, which in turn notes a lack of literature context and a missing baseline.",
          "overall": "The reviews align strongly on the paper's strengths but only moderately on its weaknesses, resulting in different critical angles. While both view the paper as a valuable contribution with flaws, Review B's critique is much more focused on internal methodological rigor and confounds, whereas Review A's is more high-level and concerned with missing context and baselines."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions, namely the empirical refutation of several common assumptions about multilingual pretraining (e.g., the \"curse of multilinguality\"). They also agree that the paper's primary strength is its innovative and large-scale experimental approach, though Review B provides much more detail on specific aspects of this rigor.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on two major weaknesses: the potential for tokenizer bias and the limited scope of the pivot language experiments. However, Review B identifies several additional, significant issues that Review A misses, such as a lack of evaluation granularity and confounding variables in the experimental design, while Review A uniquely critiques the paper's grounding in prior work.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment in their overall judgment, viewing the paper as a valuable and rigorous empirical study with some notable limitations. They strongly agree on the paper's strengths, but only moderately on its weaknesses, as Review B provides a much more detailed and extensive critique of the methodology and reporting."
