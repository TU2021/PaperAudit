The data-driven module fine-tunes an 8B LLaMA 3.1 regressor with 1% labeled data to generate pseudo-labels for unsampled points (Section 3.3, Eq. (1), Appendix D), while the knowledge-driven module uses hybrid RAG with GPT-4o to rank variable importance and cluster candidates by physicochemical properties, building a hierarchical tree explored via UCB to select promising subspaces (Section 3.4, Figure 1). BO is then conducted in selected subspaces using a GP with pseudo-data priors (Section 3.5). Experiments on Suzuki, Arylation, and Buchwald subsets show improved best-found values, faster convergence, and better initialization relative to baselines (Figure 2, Tables 2–4), with additional wet-lab validation achieving 96% yield in 2 iterations (Appendix H, Figure 5).Strengths\n- Boldly synergistic knowledge- and data-driven design\n  - Evidence: The framework architecture explicitly couples LLM-guided space partitioning with LLM-generated pseudo-data in a closed loop (Section 3.2–3.5, Figure 1, Appendix F Algorithm 1). Why it matters: Combining complementary strategies addresses both the “cold start” and “curse of dimensionality” in BO, increasing impact and novelty.\n  - Evidence: The data module creates an informative prior via pseudo-labels, while the knowledge module constrains BO to high-value subspaces (Section 3.3 Step 3; Section 3.4 Step 3; Appendix D). Why it matters: This integration is technically sound and directly operationalized through UCB-guided subspace selection, promising efficiency.\n  - Evidence: Ablations indicate each module contributes and the synergy is necessary; removing either or both harms performance and speed (Table 4; Section 4.4). Why it matters: Empirical corroboration strengthens the claim of synergistic design rather than additive components.- Strong empirical performance across multiple benchmarks\n  - Evidence: ChemBOMAS attains highest or tied-highest best-found values with faster convergence on Suzuki (96.15%, 3 iterations), Arylation (81.26%, 39 iterations), Buchwald_sub-1 (80.00%, 23 iterations), and Buchwald_sub-2 (56.80%, 2 iterations) (Section 4.3.3; Figure 2; Table 5 for maxima). Why it matters: Demonstrates practical effectiveness over diverse reaction spaces and robustness of the approach.\n  - Evidence: Tree-based strategies outperform “BO w/o tree” with drastic reductions in “95% Max Iter” across datasets (Table 2). Why it matters: Validates the knowledge-driven partitioning and UCB traversal as impactful for sample efficiency.\n  - Evidence: Variance bands in Figure 2 show consistently narrower spreads for ChemBOMAS vs baselines. Why it matters: Suggests stability over random seeds, a key experimental rigor dimension.- Efficient pseudo-data generation with minimal labeled data\n  - Evidence: Fine-tuning with only 1% labeled data yields positive R² (0.20/0.13/0.20 on Suzuki/Arylation/Buchwald), outperforming zero-shot general LLMs and most open models (Table 1; Section 4.3.1). Why it matters: Addresses early-stage data scarcity and provides a practical path to warm-start BO.\n  - Evidence: The 1% threshold is empirically justified as the point where R² turns positive across datasets and suffices for BO to locate high-performing conditions (Tables 7–8; Section 4.3.1). Why it matters: Offers a cost-effective operational guideline.\n  - Evidence: The pre-training task on Pistachio (50k entries) followed by LoRA fine-tuning and an MLP regression head is clearly specified (Section 3.3 Steps 1–2; Eq. (1)). Why it matters: Technical clarity of the modeling pipeline supports soundness and reproducibility.- UCB-guided hierarchical subspace selection\n  - Evidence: The UCB formulation and layer-wise top-5 node selection are described, with dynamic updates as BO proceeds (Section 3.4 Step 3). Why it matters: Provides a principled exploration–exploitation mechanism over the knowledge-structured tree.\n  - Evidence: Quantitative improvements in “95% Max Iter” and initial performance when using knowledge-driven clustering (ChemBOMASk-d) vs data-driven clustering and BO w/o tree (Table 2). Why it matters: Confirms that knowledge integration enhances practical efficiency beyond purely data-driven schemes.- Real-world wet-lab validation\n  - Evidence: A previously unreported reaction achieved 96% yield in 2 iterations (43 samples), surpassing 15% achieved by a chemist using control-variable methods (Appendix H, Figure 5; Section 4.3.3). Why it matters: Demonstrates practical utility and impact beyond synthetic benchmarks.\n  - Evidence: Repeatability tests show strong initialization: multiple runs found >60% yields in the initial round, with >80% yields in 70% of tests (Appendix H.2). Why it matters: Supports robustness of initialization critical to real deployments.- Methodological transparency and auxiliary details that aid replication\n  - Evidence: Pseudocode of the full algorithm (Appendix F, Algorithm 1) and prompts for both modules (Appendix G.1–G.2) are provided. Why it matters: Improves clarity and replicability compared to many LLM-augmented methods.\n  - Evidence: Dual-pronged pseudo-data refinement with similarity-based pruning and performance-based removal is formalized (Appendix D, Eq. (2)–(3)). Why it matters: Addresses potential noise/overconfidence in pseudo-labels, adding technical rigor.\n  - Evidence: Experimental setup specifies budgets, batch percentages, acquisition functions, hyperparameters, and seed averaging (Section 4.2; Appendix I.1). Why it matters: Enhances experimental transparency and validity.Weaknesses\n- Limited reproducibility of the knowledge-driven module and reliance on proprietary tooling\n  - Evidence: The partitioning uses GPT-4o API and hybrid RAG with “multi-source information” but the concrete corpora, retrieval pipeline, and property data sources are not fully specified beyond tooling placeholders (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2 “Available Tools”; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for the exact corpus contents and access procedures). Why it matters: Without a fixed, shareable corpus and explicit retrieval protocols, reproducing clustering and importance ranking is difficult, reducing impact and scientific transparency.\n  - Evidence: The clustering relies on physicochemical properties determined by the LLM; precise property databases and quantitative thresholds used for grouping are not enumerated (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2). Why it matters: The absence of concrete numeric criteria limits interpretability and repeatability.\n  - Evidence: Pre-training details (e.g., tokenization specifics, sequence formatting choices beyond the general prompt structure, optimization settings) are sparse for Pistachio (Section 3.3 Step 1; Appendix C.1 mentions dataset scope but not training configuration). Why it matters: Underdocumented pre-training can impact regression quality and makes replication challenging.- Statistical reporting and significance analyses are limited\n  - Evidence: While Figure 2 shows variance bands across 5 seeds (Section 4.2), there are no reported standard deviations, confidence intervals, or hypothesis tests for between-method comparisons (Section 4.3.3; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for statistical tests). Why it matters: Lack of statistical testing weakens claims of superiority and robustness.\n  - Evidence: Claims of “lowest variance” and stability are visual/qualitative; quantitative measures (e.g., variance or interquartile ranges) are not tabulated (Section 4.3.3; Figure 2). Why it matters: Quantitative evidence is important for rigorous evaluation.\n  - Evidence: Wet-lab results report a single optimization trajectory and a 10-run initialization study without formal statistical analysis (Appendix H, H.2; Figure 5). Why it matters: Real-world claims benefit from significance testing and confidence intervals to assess reliability.- Baseline comparability and fairness could be clearer\n  - Evidence: In optimization comparisons (Figure 2; Section 4.3.3), it is unclear whether baselines are allowed an equivalent warm-start via pseudo-data or knowledge priors; only the clustering comparison (Section 4.3.2) explicitly states “identical, fixed pseudo-data” across methods (Table 2), but this does not apply to Figure 2. Why it matters: If ChemBOMAS benefits from pseudo-data and knowledge partitioning while baselines do not, comparisons may conflate methodological advantages with initialization benefits.\n  - Evidence: LA-MCTS and BO-ICL may require differing configurations; beyond stating “acquisition function and other BO configurations were kept consistent” (Section 4.2), detailed parameter harmonization for each baseline is limited (Appendix C.4; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for per-baseline hyperparameter grids and sensitivity checks). Why it matters: Fair benchmarking demands carefully aligned budgets and settings or per-method tuning.\n  - Evidence: Sensitivity to UCB exploration constant (κ=20), top-5 selection rule, and tree depth is not analyzed (Section 4.2; Section 3.4 Step 3; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for sensitivity studies). Why it matters: Without sensitivity analyses, performance gains may depend on specific hyperparameter choices.- Inconsistencies and clarity issues in reported efficiency claims and metrics\n  - Evidence: Section 4.3.2 claims “up to a 34-fold improvement” vs BO w/o tree, but Table 2’s largest “95% Max Iter” reduction appears to be 26× (26 to 1 for Buchwald_sub-1) and 29× (29 to 1 for Suzuki ChemBOMASd-d), not 34×. Why it matters: Overstated claims can undermine credibility.\n  - Evidence: The abstract states “accelerating optimization efficiency by up to 5-fold compared to baseline methods,” yet the tree-based gains reported in Table 2 exceed 5× on several datasets; the relationship to the abstract’s “baseline methods” is unclear (Abstract; Table 2). Why it matters: Consistent framing of baselines and fold improvements improves clarity.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.3.1 asserts “R² scores exceeding the second-best model by 2000% and 140%” on Arylation and Buchwald; given small positive R² values (e.g., 0.13 vs 0.09; 0.20 vs 0.08 in Table 1), percent-improvement language on bounded metrics is potentially misleading. Why it matters: Clear, standard reporting avoids confusion and misinterpretation.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Enhance reproducibility of the knowledge-driven module and pre-training\n  - Release a fixed, versioned retrieval corpus and scripts (or snapshots) used for hybrid RAG, including precise sources and access steps; provide a deterministic pipeline for variable importance ranking and clustering, ideally with open models to replace GPT-4o where feasible (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2; actionable by sharing code/data).\n  - Enumerate the physicochemical properties, databases, and numeric thresholds or clustering criteria used per variable class; include property tables for candidates and decision rules (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2; verifiable by reproducing cluster assignments).\n  - Document pre-training configurations comprehensively: tokenizer, prompt formats, sequence lengths, optimizer, learning rates, epochs, and Pistachio sampling strategy (Section 3.3 Step 1; Appendix C.1; verifiable via released configs and scripts).- Strengthen statistical reporting and significance analyses\n  - Report per-method means with standard deviations or confidence intervals across seeds for key metrics (best-found, 95% Max Iter, initialization values), and include statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests or non-parametric tests) to assess significance (Section 4.3.3; Figure 2; implementable by augmenting result tables/plots).\n  - Quantify variance claims by tabulating dispersion measures (e.g., IQRs, variances) rather than relying on shaded plots; add robustness analyses for different batch sizes beyond runtime (Appendix I.1; provide numeric variance).\n  - For wet-lab experiments, report confidence intervals over repeated rounds and a formal analysis of repeatability (Appendix H, H.2; include statistical tests to substantiate superiority over the expert baseline).- Improve baseline comparability and sensitivity analyses\n  - Provide optimization comparisons where baselines receive analogous warm-starts (e.g., pseudo-data generated by their own surrogates or a shared neutral model), and separately report “with/without warm-start” results to isolate ChemBOMAS’s structural advantages (Figure 2; Section 4.3.3; verifiable by additional tables).\n  - Detail per-baseline hyperparameters and conduct sensitivity/tuning sweeps to ensure competitive settings for LA-MCTS, GOLLuM, BO-ICL, and BO, including acquisition function choices where applicable (Section 4.2; Appendix C.4; reproducible via logs/configs).\n  - Add sensitivity analyses for tree/UCB settings (e.g., κ values, top-k selection per layer, tree depth) and report their impact on performance and efficiency (Section 3.4 Step 3; verifiable via ablation tables).- Resolve inconsistencies and clarify efficiency metrics\n  - Align fold-improvement statements with tabled values; correct the “up to 34-fold” claim or provide explicit calculations and anchors (Section 4.3.2; Table 2; update text/figures accordingly).\n  - Clarify the definition and computation of “95% Max Iter,” and maintain consistent baselines when citing “up to 5-fold” gains in the abstract vs the main text (Abstract; Section 4.3.2; add metric definitions).\n  - Replace percent-improvement language for bounded metrics like R² with absolute differences or standardized effect sizes; revise Section 4.3.1 wording and add a note on interpretability of small R² gains (Table 1; enhance clarity with standardized reporting).Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Novel, well-executed synergy with strong empirical gains across benchmarks and a real wet-lab validation, but reproducibility and statistical rigor need strengthening (Figure 2; Tables 2–4; Appendix H).\n- Novelty (10): 7 — Integrates LLM-driven knowledge partitioning with pseudo-data warm-started BO in a closed loop beyond prior single-technique accelerations (Section 3.2–3.5; Table 4).\n- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Sound algorithmic design and ablations, yet limited statistical testing, sensitivity analyses, and incomplete reproducibility details temper confidence (Section 4.3.3; Section 4.4; Appendix G.2).\n- Clarity (10): 7 — Clear high-level methodology with helpful pseudocode and prompts, though some claims and metric definitions need alignment and precision (Figure 1; Appendix F; Section 4.3.1; Section 4.3.2).\n- Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence based on detailed manuscript, multiple datasets, and wet-lab validation, but some reporting gaps and reliance on proprietary tools reduce certainty (Section 4.2; Appendix H).",

The data module pre-trains and fine-tunes an 8B LLaMA 3.1 regressor on 1% labeled data to produce pseudo-data that warm-start BO (Section 3.3; Eq.

Why it matters: If ChemBOMAS benefits from pseudo-data and knowledge partitioning while baselines do not, comparisons may conflate methodological advantages with initialization benefits.\n  - Evidence: LA-MCTS and BO-ICL may require differing configurations; beyond stating “acquisition function and other BO configurations were kept consistent” (Section 4.2), detailed parameter harmonization for each baseline is limited (Appendix C.4; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for per-baseline hyperparameter grids and sensitivity checks).

Why it matters: Without sensitivity analyses, performance gains may depend on specific hyperparameter choices.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.3.2 states “All methods were initialized with an identical, fixed set of pseudo-data,” yet Table 2 shows different “Initial (%)” values across clustering strategies (e.g., Suzuki: 54.04 for BO w/o tree vs 72.98 for ChemBOMAS variants) (Section 4.3.2; Table 2). Why it matters: Discrepant initial values under an “identical, fixed” prior complicate fairness and interpretation.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.2 specifies “initialized with 1% of the data as the prior,” but Table 4 reports markedly different initial values across ablations on the same dataset (e.g., Arylation Initial (%) varies from 45.40 to 78.71) (Section 4.2; Table 4). Why it matters: Divergent initializations undermine comparability when ablations are intended to isolate module contributions.\n- Inconsistencies and clarity issues in reported efficiency claims and metrics\n  - Evidence: Section 4.3.2 claims “up to a 34-fold improvement” vs BO w/o tree, but Table 2’s largest “95% Max Iter” reductions appear to be 13× (e.g., 26→2 for Buchwald_sub-1; 13→1 for Buchwald_sub-2) and 8× (8→1 for Arylation) (Table 2).

Why it matters: Clear, standard reporting avoids confusion and misinterpretation.\n  - Evidence: The wet-lab section reports “96% after evaluating only 43 samples in 2 iterations,” while Appendix H indicates 14 samples per round with multiple rounds displayed in Figure 5 (Appendix H; Figure 5; Appendix H.2). Why it matters: Iteration/sample accounting should be consistent to support real-world efficiency claims.\n- Algorithmic inconsistency in UCB traversal and constants\n  - Evidence: Section 3.4 Step 3 states “At each layer, the top-5 nodes by UCB value are selected for further exploration,” while Appendix F Algorithm 1 greedily selects a single child per layer via arg max (Section 3.4 Step 3; Appendix F, Algorithm 1). Why it matters: Contradictory traversal policies affect how subspaces are chosen and may change performance characteristics.\n  - Evidence: The exploration constant is denoted C_p in Section 3.4 and κ in Section 4.2 without an explicit equivalence or rationale for choosing 20 (Section 3.4 Step 3; Section 4.2). Why it matters: Notational and configuration ambiguity hinders reproducibility and sensitivity assessment.\n  - Evidence: Algorithm 1 uses ln(n_parent) in UCB without describing an initialization policy for n_parent=0 (Appendix F, Algorithm 1; Section 3.4 Step 3). Why it matters: Edge-case handling is required to implement the algorithm deterministically from scratch.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Enhance reproducibility of the knowledge-driven module and pre-training\n  - Release a fixed, versioned retrieval corpus and scripts (or snapshots) used for hybrid RAG, including precise sources and access steps; provide a deterministic pipeline for variable importance ranking and clustering, ideally with open models to replace GPT-4o where feasible (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2; actionable by sharing code/data).\n  - Enumerate the physicochemical properties, databases, and numeric thresholds or clustering criteria used per variable class; include property tables for candidates and decision rules (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2; verifiable by reproducing cluster assignments).\n  - Document pre-training configurations comprehensively: tokenizer, prompt formats, sequence lengths, optimizer, learning rates, epochs, and Pistachio sampling strategy (Section 3.3 Step 1; Appendix C.1; verifiable via released configs and scripts).\n- Strengthen statistical reporting and significance analyses\n  - Report per-method means with standard deviations or confidence intervals across seeds for key metrics (best-found, 95% Max Iter, initialization values), and include statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests or non-parametric tests) to assess significance (Section 4.3.3;

Section 4.3.3; verifiable by additional tables).\n  - Detail per-baseline hyperparameters and conduct sensitivity/tuning sweeps to ensure competitive settings for LA-MCTS, GOLLuM, BO-ICL, and BO, including acquisition function choices where applicable (Section 4.2; Appendix C.4; reproducible via logs/configs).\n  - Add sensitivity analyses for tree/UCB settings (e.g., κ values, top-k selection per layer, tree depth) and report their impact on performance and efficiency (Section 3.4 Step 3; verifiable via ablation tables).\n  - When stating identical prior pseudo-data or 1% initialization, ensure initial values align across methods/ablations or explicitly explain differences; include tables confirming identical priors and initialization for fairness (Section 4.3.2; Section 4.2; Tables 2 and 4; verifiable via shared seeds and initial sets).\n  - For ablations, use truly matched initializations so the isolated effect of each module can be assessed; document any deviations and their rationale (Table 4; Section 4.4; reproducible via configuration manifests).\n- Resolve inconsistencies and clarify efficiency metrics\n  - Align fold-improvement statements with tabled values; correct the “up to 34-fold” claim or provide explicit calculations and anchors (Section 4.3.2; Table 2; update text/figures accordingly).\n  - Clarify the definition and computation of “95% Max Iter,” and maintain consistent baselines when citing “up to 5-fold” gains in the abstract vs the main text (Abstract; Section 4.3.2; add metric definitions).\n  - Replace percent-improvement language for bounded metrics like R² with absolute differences or standardized effect sizes; revise Section 4.3.1 wording and add a note on interpretability of small R² gains (Table 1; enhance clarity with standardized reporting).\n  - Make wet-lab iteration/sample accounting consistent: specify samples per iteration, total iterations, and sample counts leading to the 96% result; reconcile the “2 iterations” and “43 samples” statements with Figure 5 protocol (Appendix H; Figure 5; Appendix H.2).\n- Clarify and unify UCB traversal and constants\n  - Provide a single, consistent traversal policy across Section 3.4 and Algorithm 1 (e.g., confirm top-k per layer vs greedy single-path), and update pseudocode/figures accordingly (Section 3.4 Step 3; Appendix F).\n  - Unify notation (κ vs C_p), justify the chosen exploration constant (e.g., κ=20), and add sensitivity analysis to demonstrate robustness (Section 3.4 Step 3; Section 4.2).\n  - Specify initialization for UCB at the root (handling n_parent=0) and any smoothing or priors used to avoid divide-by-zero/log(0) issues (Appendix F; Section 3.4 Step 3; add implementable defaults).Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Strong empirical gains and a compelling synergy of knowledge- and data-driven modules with wet-lab validation, but algorithmic and reporting inconsistencies temper impact (Figure 2; Tables 2, 4; Section 3.4; Appendix F; Appendix H).\n- Novelty (10): 7 — Integrates LLM-driven knowledge partitioning with pseudo-data warm-started BO in a closed loop beyond prior single-technique accelerations (Section 3.2–3.5; Table 4).\n- Technical Quality (10): 5 — Solid framework and ablations, but contradictions in UCB traversal, fairness/initialization discrepancies, and limited statistical testing reduce confidence (Section 3.4; Appendix F; Tables 2, 4; Section 4.3.3).\n- Clarity (10): 6 — Clear high-level methodology and helpful pseudocode/prompts, yet multiple mismatches (fold claims, R² percentage language, wet-lab iteration/sample counts, notation κ vs C_p) need alignment (Section 4.3.1; Section 4.3.2; Appendix H; Section 4.2).\n- Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence based on detailed manuscript, multiple datasets, and wet-lab validation, with some uncertainty due to noted inconsistencies and reliance on proprietary tools (Section 4.2; Section 3.4; Appendix H).",

  "reviews": "Summary\n- The paper proposes ChemBOMAS, an LLM-enhanced multi-agent framework for accelerating Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemical reaction optimization by combining a data-driven pseudo-labeling module with a knowledge-driven search-space decomposition module. The data module pre-trains and fine-tunes an 8B LLaMA 3.1 regressor on 1% labeled data to produce pseudo-data that warm-start BO (Section 3.3; Eq. (1); Appendix C.1; Appendix F), while the knowledge module uses a hybrid RAG with GPT-4o to rank variable importance, cluster candidates via physicochemical properties, and construct a hierarchical tree explored by UCB to select promising subspaces (Section 3.4; Figure 1). BO is performed within selected subspaces using a GP with Matérn kernel, leveraging real and pseudo-data (Section 3.5). Experiments across Suzuki, Arylation, and Buchwald subsets show improved best-found values and faster convergence relative to baselines (Figure 2; Tables 2, 4), with an additional wet-lab validation reporting 96% yield in two iterations (Appendix H; Figure 5).Strengths\n- Boldly synergistic knowledge- and data-driven design\n  - Evidence: The framework architecture explicitly couples LLM-guided space partitioning with LLM-generated pseudo-data in a closed loop (Section 3.2–3.5; Figure 1; Appendix F Algorithm 1). Why it matters: Combining complementary strategies addresses both the “cold start” and “curse of dimensionality” in BO, increasing impact and novelty.\n  - Evidence: The data module creates an informative prior via pseudo-labels, while the knowledge module constrains BO to high-value subspaces (Section 3.3 Step 3; Section 3.4 Step 3; Appendix D). Why it matters: This integration is technically sound and directly operationalized through UCB-guided subspace selection, promising efficiency.\n  - Evidence: Ablations indicate each module contributes and the synergy is necessary; removing either or both harms performance and speed (Table 4; Section 4.4). Why it matters: Empirical corroboration strengthens the claim of synergistic design rather than additive components.\n- Strong empirical performance across multiple benchmarks\n  - Evidence: ChemBOMAS attains highest or tied-highest best-found values with faster convergence on Suzuki (96.15%, 3 iterations), Arylation (81.26%, 39 iterations), Buchwald_sub-1 (80.00%, 23 iterations), and Buchwald_sub-2 (56.80%, 2 iterations) (Section 4.3.3; Figure 2; Table 5 for dataset maxima). Why it matters: Demonstrates practical effectiveness over diverse reaction spaces and robustness of the approach.\n  - Evidence: Tree-based strategies outperform “BO w/o tree” with drastic reductions in “95% Max Iter” across datasets (Table 2). Why it matters: Validates the knowledge-driven partitioning and UCB traversal as impactful for sample efficiency.\n  - Evidence: Variance bands in Figure 2 show consistently narrower spreads for ChemBOMAS vs baselines (Section 4.2 states five seeds; Figure 2). Why it matters: Suggests stability over random seeds, a key experimental rigor dimension.\n- Efficient pseudo-data generation with minimal labeled data\n  - Evidence: Fine-tuning with only 1% labeled data yields positive R² (0.20/0.13/0.20 on Suzuki/Arylation/Buchwald), outperforming zero-shot general LLMs and several open models in two datasets (Table 1; Section 4.3.1). Why it matters: Addresses early-stage data scarcity and provides a practical path to warm-start BO.\n  - Evidence: The 1% threshold is empirically justified as the point where R² turns positive across datasets and suffices for BO to locate high-performing conditions (Table 7; Table 8; Section I.2). Why it matters: Offers a cost-effective operational guideline.\n  - Evidence: The pre-training task on Pistachio (~50k entries subset) followed by LoRA fine-tuning and an MLP regression head is clearly specified (Section 3.3 Steps 1–2; Eq. (1); Appendix C.1). Why it matters: Technical clarity of the modeling pipeline supports soundness and reproducibility.\n- UCB-guided hierarchical subspace selection\n  - Evidence: The UCB formulation and selection strategy are described, with dynamic updates as BO proceeds (Section 3.4 Step 3). Why it matters: Provides a principled exploration–exploitation mechanism over the knowledge-structured tree.\n  - Evidence: Quantitative improvements in “95% Max Iter” and initial performance when using knowledge-driven clustering (ChemBOMASk-d) vs data-driven clustering and BO w/o tree (Table 2). Why it matters: Confirms that knowledge integration enhances practical efficiency beyond purely data-driven schemes.\n- Real-world wet-lab validation\n  - Evidence: A previously unreported reaction achieved 96% yield, reported at “2 iterations” with 43 samples evaluated (Appendix H, Figure 5; Section 4.3.3). Why it matters: Demonstrates practical utility and impact beyond synthetic benchmarks.\n  - Evidence: Repeatability tests show strong initialization: multiple runs found >60% yields in the initial round, with >80% yields in 70% of tests (Appendix H.2). Why it matters: Supports robustness of initialization critical to real deployments.\n- Methodological transparency and auxiliary details that aid replication\n  - Evidence: Pseudocode of the full algorithm (Appendix F, Algorithm 1) and prompts for both modules (Appendix G.1–G.2) are provided. Why it matters: Improves clarity and replicability compared to many LLM-augmented methods.\n  - Evidence: Dual-pronged pseudo-data refinement with similarity-based pruning and performance-based removal is formalized (Appendix D, Eq. (2)–(3)). Why it matters: Addresses potential noise/overconfidence in pseudo-labels, adding technical rigor.\n  - Evidence: Experimental setup specifies budgets, batch percentages, acquisition functions, hyperparameters, and seed averaging (Section 4.2; Appendix I.1; Appendix C.4). Why it matters: Enhances experimental transparency and validity.Weaknesses\n- Limited reproducibility of the knowledge-driven module and reliance on proprietary tooling\n  - Evidence: The partitioning uses GPT-4o API and hybrid RAG with “multi-source information” but the concrete corpora, retrieval pipeline, and property data sources are not fully specified beyond tooling placeholders (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2 “Available Tools”; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for the exact corpus contents and access procedures). Why it matters: Without a fixed, shareable corpus and explicit retrieval protocols, reproducing clustering and importance ranking is difficult, reducing impact and scientific transparency.\n  - Evidence: The clustering relies on physicochemical properties determined by the LLM; precise property databases and quantitative thresholds used for grouping are not enumerated (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2). Why it matters: The absence of concrete numeric criteria limits interpretability and repeatability.\n  - Evidence: Pre-training details (e.g., tokenization specifics, sequence formatting choices beyond the general prompt structure, optimization settings) are sparse for Pistachio (Section 3.3 Step 1; Appendix C.1 mentions dataset scope but not training configuration). Why it matters: Underdocumented pre-training can impact regression quality and makes replication challenging.\n- Statistical reporting and significance analyses are limited\n  - Evidence: While Figure 2 shows variance bands across 5 seeds (Section 4.2), there are no reported standard deviations, confidence intervals, or hypothesis tests for between-method comparisons (Section 4.3.3; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for statistical tests). Why it matters: Lack of statistical testing weakens claims of superiority and robustness.\n  - Evidence: Claims of “lowest variance” and stability are visual/qualitative; quantitative measures (e.g., variance or interquartile ranges) are not tabulated (Section 4.3.3; Figure 2). Why it matters: Quantitative evidence is important for rigorous evaluation.\n  - Evidence: Wet-lab results report a single optimization trajectory and a 10-run initialization study without formal statistical analysis (Appendix H, H.2; Figure 5). Why it matters: Real-world claims benefit from significance testing and confidence intervals to assess reliability.\n- Baseline comparability and fairness could be clearer\n  - Evidence: In optimization comparisons (Figure 2; Section 4.3.3), it is unclear whether baselines are allowed an equivalent warm-start via pseudo-data or knowledge priors; only the clustering comparison (Section 4.3.2) explicitly states “identical, fixed pseudo-data” across methods (Table 2), but this does not apply to Figure 2. Why it matters: If ChemBOMAS benefits from pseudo-data and knowledge partitioning while baselines do not, comparisons may conflate methodological advantages with initialization benefits.\n  - Evidence: LA-MCTS and BO-ICL may require differing configurations; beyond stating “acquisition function and other BO configurations were kept consistent” (Section 4.2), detailed parameter harmonization for each baseline is limited (Appendix C.4; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for per-baseline hyperparameter grids and sensitivity checks). Why it matters: Fair benchmarking demands carefully aligned budgets and settings or per-method tuning.\n  - Evidence: Sensitivity to UCB exploration constant (κ=20), top-5 selection rule, and tree depth is not analyzed (Section 4.2; Section 3.4 Step 3; No direct evidence found in the manuscript for sensitivity studies). Why it matters: Without sensitivity analyses, performance gains may depend on specific hyperparameter choices.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.3.2 states “All methods were initialized with an identical, fixed set of pseudo-data,” yet Table 2 shows different “Initial (%)” values across clustering strategies (e.g., Suzuki: 54.04 for BO w/o tree vs 72.98 for ChemBOMAS variants) (Section 4.3.2; Table 2). Why it matters: Discrepant initial values under an “identical, fixed” prior complicate fairness and interpretation.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.2 specifies “initialized with 1% of the data as the prior,” but Table 4 reports markedly different initial values across ablations on the same dataset (e.g., Arylation Initial (%) varies from 45.40 to 78.71) (Section 4.2; Table 4). Why it matters: Divergent initializations undermine comparability when ablations are intended to isolate module contributions.\n- Inconsistencies and clarity issues in reported efficiency claims and metrics\n  - Evidence: Section 4.3.2 claims “up to a 34-fold improvement” vs BO w/o tree, but Table 2’s largest “95% Max Iter” reductions appear to be 13× (e.g., 26→2 for Buchwald_sub-1; 13→1 for Buchwald_sub-2) and 8× (8→1 for Arylation) (Table 2). Why it matters: Overstated claims can undermine credibility.\n  - Evidence: The abstract states “accelerating optimization efficiency by up to 5-fold compared to baseline methods,” yet the tree-based gains reported in Table 2 exceed 5× on several datasets; the relationship to the abstract’s “baseline methods” is unclear (Abstract; Table 2). Why it matters: Consistent framing of baselines and fold improvements improves clarity.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.3.1 asserts “R² scores exceeding the second-best model by 2000% and 140%” on Arylation and Buchwald; given small positive R² values (e.g., 0.13 vs 0.09; 0.20 vs 0.08 in Table 1), percent-improvement language on bounded metrics is potentially misleading (Section 4.3.1; Table 1). Why it matters: Clear, standard reporting avoids confusion and misinterpretation.\n  - Evidence: The wet-lab section reports “96% after evaluating only 43 samples in 2 iterations,” while Appendix H indicates 14 samples per round with multiple rounds displayed in Figure 5 (Appendix H; Figure 5; Appendix H.2). Why it matters: Iteration/sample accounting should be consistent to support real-world efficiency claims.\n- Algorithmic inconsistency in UCB traversal and constants\n  - Evidence: Section 3.4 Step 3 states “At each layer, the top-5 nodes by UCB value are selected for further exploration,” while Appendix F Algorithm 1 greedily selects a single child per layer via arg max (Section 3.4 Step 3; Appendix F, Algorithm 1). Why it matters: Contradictory traversal policies affect how subspaces are chosen and may change performance characteristics.\n  - Evidence: The exploration constant is denoted C_p in Section 3.4 and κ in Section 4.2 without an explicit equivalence or rationale for choosing 20 (Section 3.4 Step 3; Section 4.2). Why it matters: Notational and configuration ambiguity hinders reproducibility and sensitivity assessment.\n  - Evidence: Algorithm 1 uses ln(n_parent) in UCB without describing an initialization policy for n_parent=0 (Appendix F, Algorithm 1; Section 3.4 Step 3). Why it matters: Edge-case handling is required to implement the algorithm deterministically from scratch.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Enhance reproducibility of the knowledge-driven module and pre-training\n  - Release a fixed, versioned retrieval corpus and scripts (or snapshots) used for hybrid RAG, including precise sources and access steps; provide a deterministic pipeline for variable importance ranking and clustering, ideally with open models to replace GPT-4o where feasible (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2; actionable by sharing code/data).\n  - Enumerate the physicochemical properties, databases, and numeric thresholds or clustering criteria used per variable class; include property tables for candidates and decision rules (Section 3.4 Step 1; Appendix G.2; verifiable by reproducing cluster assignments).\n  - Document pre-training configurations comprehensively: tokenizer, prompt formats, sequence lengths, optimizer, learning rates, epochs, and Pistachio sampling strategy (Section 3.3 Step 1; Appendix C.1; verifiable via released configs and scripts).\n- Strengthen statistical reporting and significance analyses\n  - Report per-method means with standard deviations or confidence intervals across seeds for key metrics (best-found, 95% Max Iter, initialization values), and include statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests or non-parametric tests) to assess significance (Section 4.3.3; Figure 2; implementable by augmenting result tables/plots).\n  - Quantify variance claims by tabulating dispersion measures (e.g., IQRs, variances) rather than relying on shaded plots; add robustness analyses for different batch sizes beyond runtime (Appendix I.1; provide numeric variance).\n  - For wet-lab experiments, report confidence intervals over repeated rounds and a formal analysis of repeatability (Appendix H, H.2; include statistical tests to substantiate superiority over the expert baseline).\n- Improve baseline comparability and sensitivity analyses\n  - Provide optimization comparisons where baselines receive analogous warm-starts (e.g., pseudo-data generated by their own surrogates or a shared neutral model), and separately report “with/without warm-start” results to isolate ChemBOMAS’s structural advantages (Figure 2; Section 4.3.3; verifiable by additional tables).\n  - Detail per-baseline hyperparameters and conduct sensitivity/tuning sweeps to ensure competitive settings for LA-MCTS, GOLLuM, BO-ICL, and BO, including acquisition function choices where applicable (Section 4.2; Appendix C.4; reproducible via logs/configs).\n  - Add sensitivity analyses for tree/UCB settings (e.g., κ values, top-k selection per layer, tree depth) and report their impact on performance and efficiency (Section 3.4 Step 3; verifiable via ablation tables).\n  - When stating identical prior pseudo-data or 1% initialization, ensure initial values align across methods/ablations or explicitly explain differences; include tables confirming identical priors and initialization for fairness (Section 4.3.2; Section 4.2; Tables 2 and 4; verifiable via shared seeds and initial sets).\n  - For ablations, use truly matched initializations so the isolated effect of each module can be assessed; document any deviations and their rationale (Table 4; Section 4.4; reproducible via configuration manifests).\n- Resolve inconsistencies and clarify efficiency metrics\n  - Align fold-improvement statements with tabled values; correct the “up to 34-fold” claim or provide explicit calculations and anchors (Section 4.3.2; Table 2; update text/figures accordingly).\n  - Clarify the definition and computation of “95% Max Iter,” and maintain consistent baselines when citing “up to 5-fold” gains in the abstract vs the main text (Abstract; Section 4.3.2; add metric definitions).\n  - Replace percent-improvement language for bounded metrics like R² with absolute differences or standardized effect sizes; revise Section 4.3.1 wording and add a note on interpretability of small R² gains (Table 1; enhance clarity with standardized reporting).\n  - Make wet-lab iteration/sample accounting consistent: specify samples per iteration, total iterations, and sample counts leading to the 96% result; reconcile the “2 iterations” and “43 samples” statements with Figure 5 protocol (Appendix H; Figure 5; Appendix H.2).\n- Clarify and unify UCB traversal and constants\n  - Provide a single, consistent traversal policy across Section 3.4 and Algorithm 1 (e.g., confirm top-k per layer vs greedy single-path), and update pseudocode/figures accordingly (Section 3.4 Step 3; Appendix F).\n  - Unify notation (κ vs C_p), justify the chosen exploration constant (e.g., κ=20), and add sensitivity analysis to demonstrate robustness (Section 3.4 Step 3; Section 4.2).\n  - Specify initialization for UCB at the root (handling n_parent=0) and any smoothing or priors used to avoid divide-by-zero/log(0) issues (Appendix F; Section 3.4 Step 3; add implementable defaults).Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Strong empirical gains and a compelling synergy of knowledge- and data-driven modules with wet-lab validation, but algorithmic and reporting inconsistencies temper impact (Figure 2; Tables 2, 4; Section 3.4; Appendix F; Appendix H).\n- Novelty (10): 7 — Integrates LLM-driven knowledge partitioning with pseudo-data warm-started BO in a closed loop beyond prior single-technique accelerations (Section 3.2–3.5; Table 4).\n- Technical Quality (10): 5 — Solid framework and ablations, but contradictions in UCB traversal, fairness/initialization discrepancies, and limited statistical testing reduce confidence (Section 3.4; Appendix F; Tables 2, 4; Section 4.3.3).\n- Clarity (10): 6 — Clear high-level methodology and helpful pseudocode/prompts, yet multiple mismatches (fold claims, R² percentage language, wet-lab iteration/sample counts, notation κ vs C_p) need alignment (Section 4.3.1; Section 4.3.2; Appendix H; Section 4.2).\n- Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence based on detailed manuscript, multiple datasets, and wet-lab validation, with some uncertainty due to noted inconsistencies and reliance on proprietary tools (Section 4.2; Section 3.4; Appendix H)."
