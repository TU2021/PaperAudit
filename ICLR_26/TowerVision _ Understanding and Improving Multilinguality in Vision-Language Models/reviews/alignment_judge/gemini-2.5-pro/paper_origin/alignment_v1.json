          "strength": "Both reviews perfectly align on the core contributions: the systematic empirical study on multilingual VLM design, the new VisionBlocks dataset, and strong performance on culturally-grounded tasks. The emphasis on the value of the empirical insights and the new dataset is identical in both reviews.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify limited novelty and poor OCR performance as key weaknesses, and both raise concerns about evaluation rigor. However, Review B provides more specific critiques (e.g., single LLM judge, specific metrics) and they diverge on whether a counterintuitive finding about training stages is a weakness (Review A) or a valid result (Review B).",
          "overall": "The reviews show high overall alignment, agreeing on the paper's primary contribution as a valuable empirical study rather than an architectural one, and highlighting the same major strengths and weaknesses. Review B is more technically detailed in its critiques, but its overall judgment and focus are highly consistent with Review A."

However, Review B introduces several major, distinct weaknesses absent from Review A, such as the dependence on proprietary models for data/evaluation and incomplete reporting of training details, while Review A emphasizes limited architectural novelty, a point less central to Review B's critique.",
          "overall": "The reviews show very high alignment on the paper's strengths and contributions, but only moderate alignment on its weaknesses, where Review B offers a more detailed and methodologically-focused critique. While their overall positive-but-flawed judgment is similar, their focus diverges significantly in the critical assessment, with Review B highlighting major concerns about reproducibility and transparency that Review A misses."
