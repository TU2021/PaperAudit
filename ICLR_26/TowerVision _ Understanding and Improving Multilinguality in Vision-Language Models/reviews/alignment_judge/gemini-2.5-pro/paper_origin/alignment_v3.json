While topic overlap is high, this sentiment mismatch lowers the weakness recall. Review B adds a specific concern regarding video data transparency but otherwise adheres to the substantive topics raised by the human reviewers."

Furthermore, the AI misses the human request for qualitative error analysis and video-specific ablations, while introducing its own unique concerns regarding reporting transparency and formatting inconsistencies."
