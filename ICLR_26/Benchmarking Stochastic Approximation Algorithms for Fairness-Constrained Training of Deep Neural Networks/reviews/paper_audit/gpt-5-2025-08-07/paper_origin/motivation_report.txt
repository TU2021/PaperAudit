# Innovation & Motivation Report

## 1. The Authors' Claimed Contribution
- Core Problem: Training deep neural networks under fairness constraints cast as expectation-based inequality constraints (differences in subgroup empirical losses/rates) within constrained ERM.
- Claimed Gap: “Constrained training of DNNs to improve fairness lacks a standard method.” (Abstract). The paper further emphasizes that “no algorithm has guarantees for the full general nonconvex, nonsmooth, large-scale stochastic inequality-constrained setting” (Conclusion/Caveats) and highlights the challenge that “hard constraints (rate constraints)… are nonconvex, nonsmooth, large-scale inequality constraints… [and] piecewise-constant (unsuitable for first-order methods)” (Related Work).
- Proposed Solution: A benchmark and tooling suite that (a) automates construction of fairness-constrained ERM from PyTorch/TensorFlow computation graphs, (b) supports very large sets of protected subgroup definitions (reporting up to “5.7 billion” combinations), and (c) implements and empirically compares four practical stochastic approximation methods—Stochastic Ghost (StGh), Stochastic Smoothed and Linearized Augmented Lagrangian (SSL-ALM), a plain ALM, and Stochastic Switching Subgradient (SSw)—against SGD baselines (with and without a fairness regularizer). Code is released as a Python package.

## 2. Comparative Scrutiny (The "Trial")
Here, we analyze how the paper stands against the identified similar works.

### vs. A single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method for expectation-constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization (Liu & Xu)
- Identified Overlap: Exact target setting—nonconvex, nonsmooth stochastic optimization with expectation (inequality) constraints motivated by fairness. The similar work proposes an exact-penalty, single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method with iteration complexity O(ε^{-4}) to a near-ε stationary point of the penalized problem and delivers an (ε, ε)-KKT point, showing empirical speedups over switching subgradient and inexact proximal point methods on fairness-constrained tasks.
- Manuscript's Defense: In the provided manuscript summary, this work is not cited. The manuscript frames the state of the art by stating: “Most methods do not consider stochastic constraints; among those that do, only three admit inequality constraints.” (Table 2 summary) and reiterates a broader limitation that “no algorithm has guarantees for the full general nonconvex, nonsmooth, large-scale stochastic inequality-constrained setting.” (Conclusion/Caveats). The paper positions its contribution as the first benchmark “assessing optimization methods on real-world fairness-constrained training instances” and implements three recently proposed, previously unimplemented algorithms for practice-oriented comparison, but does not include the SPIDER-type exact-penalty method in its suite nor discuss distinctions to it.
- Reviewer's Assessment: The SPIDER-type method directly targets the same expectation-constrained fairness setting, offers theory (complexity, (ε, ε)-KKT guarantees under weaker regularity than Slater), and empirically outperforms a key baseline (switching subgradient) that the manuscript implements. While the manuscript’s assertion about “no algorithm has guarantees for the full general…” remains technically accurate (the SPIDER-type method also requires regularity assumptions), omitting this closely related, theoretically-grounded and empirically-competitive method weakens the paper’s claim to provide a representative benchmark of “main stochastic approximation approaches” for fairness-constrained training. The manuscript’s gap statement—that there is no standard method—can still stand, but the lack of engagement with this work diminishes the sharpness of the motivation and the completeness of the comparative study.

### vs. A simpler approach to obtaining an O(1/t) convergence rate for the projected stochastic subgradient method (Lacoste-Julien, Schmidt, Bach)
- Identified Overlap: The manuscript’s SSw and SSL-ALM updates use projected stochastic (sub)gradient steps with iterate aggregation/selection, core ideas aligned with classical projected subgradient methods and averaging.
- Manuscript's Defense: The manuscript situates SSw within weakly convex, nonsmooth settings and explicitly uses projection and stepsize schemes (Method; Algorithm 3). It does not claim novelty in subgradient theory; rather, it leverages established stochastic subgradient structures for the constrained fairness context.
- Reviewer's Assessment: This resemblance underscores that the paper’s novelty is not algorithmic theory but application/benchmarking. No conflict with the manuscript’s claims; the overlap is expected and properly scoped.

### vs. Stochastic inequalities for single-server loss queueing systems (Abramov) and other stochastic PDE/SDE-related works
- Identified Overlap: Peripheral methodological analogies (controlling stochastic systems via constraints/inequalities; using smoothing/truncation/approximation).
- Manuscript's Defense: The manuscript does not cite or rely on these domains; its focus is fairness-constrained ERM in ML with stochastic approximation.
- Reviewer's Assessment: These works are thematically distant. They do not materially affect the manuscript’s motivation or claims.

## 3. Novelty Verdict
- Innovation Type: Application-Oriented
- Assessment:
  The manuscript’s primary innovation lies in engineering a practical benchmark and tooling for fairness-constrained ERM, automating constraint construction from computation graphs, and empirically comparing several stochastic approximation algorithms on a real dataset with fairness metrics. This fills a practical gap—there is no broadly accepted standard method for fairness-constrained training, and practitioners lack a consolidated, reproducible harness for such constraints in deep learning frameworks.

  However, the omission of a directly relevant, theoretically advanced, and empirically strong method (the exact-penalty SPIDER-type approach) weakens both the motivational framing (“main approaches”) and the empirical completeness of the benchmark. The authors’ caveat that no algorithm solves the fully general case remains valid, but the existence of recent algorithms with concrete guarantees and demonstrated superiority over some of the implemented baselines narrows the motivational gap more than the manuscript acknowledges.

  - Strength:
    - Clear problem formulation and automation pipeline for constructing fairness-constrained ERM from modern DL ecosystems.
    - Practical, side-by-side benchmarking of multiple constraint-handling stochastic methods with thorough fairness metrics (Ind, Sp, Sf, Wd) and trade-off analysis.
    - Code release and a concrete, reproducible setup on a known real-world dataset (Folktables/ACSIncome), making the benchmark accessible.

  - Weakness:
    - Does not engage with or include a key recent method (SPIDER-type exact-penalty for expectation constraints) that addresses the same setting with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance relative to included baselines, undermining the completeness of the claimed benchmark of “main approaches.”
    - The “first benchmark” claim is plausible within the specific niche of stochastic constrained in-processing methods for fairness, but the paper itself acknowledges prior benchmarks and toolkits; stronger positioning against contemporary constrained methods with guarantees would solidify the motivation.
    - Experimental scope is relatively narrow (single dataset/state; δ not specified in text), limiting generality of conclusions for a benchmark paper.

## 4. Key Evidence Anchors
- Abstract: “Constrained training of DNNs to improve fairness lacks a standard method.” and “Three recently proposed, previously unimplemented algorithms are implemented and compared… Code released…”
- Introduction/Related Work: Hard constraints/rate constraints are “nonconvex, nonsmooth, large-scale inequality constraints… piecewise-constant (unsuitable for first-order methods).” Benchmarking gap versus existing toolkits/benchmarks focused on differentiable penalties (Related Work; discussion of [30], [11], AIF360/FairLearn).
- Method: Equation (4) (fairness-constrained ERM as bounded subgroup loss differences); Table 1 (fairness notions); Table 2 (assumption landscape and claim that few methods handle stochastic inequality constraints); Algorithms 1–3 (StGh, SSL-ALM, SSw).
- Conclusion/Caveats: “No existing algorithm has guarantees for the fully general fairness-constrained problem.” and the claim of “First benchmark assessing optimization methods on real-world fairness-constrained training instances.”
- Experiments: Table 3 and Figures 1–4 (evidence that constrained methods improve Ind/Sp and Wd with accuracy trade-offs; ALM/SSL-ALM as best compromises), underscoring practical relevance of the benchmarked methods.
