Integrity and Internal-Consistency Risk Report

Scope: Assessment of clear logical/numerical inconsistencies, contradictions across sections (claims ↔ methods ↔ results), and materially missing details that affect correctness and reproducibility.

1) SSL-ALM: inequality handling via “slack variables” is stated but not reflected in the formulation or algorithm
- Evidence:
  - Section 3.3 claims: “The transition between equality and inequality constraints is handled with slack variables. Following the structure of [32], we minimize over the set X = R^n × R_{≥0}^m.” (Block 18).
  - However, the augmented Lagrangian and updates omit any slack variable s. Lρ(x,y) = F(x) + y^T C(x) + (ρ/2)||C(x)||^2 and Kρ,μ(x,y,z) depend only on (x,y,z) (Block 18, eqs. for Lρ and Kρ,μ).
  - The gradient estimator G(x,y,z; ξ, ζ1, ζ2) in (10) contains only ∇f, ∇c, and c; no slack variables (Block 18, eq. (10)).
  - The updates (11) use y_{k+1} = y_k + η c(x, ζ1) and x_{k+1} = proj_𝓧(·) (Block 18, eq. (11)), again without slack variables.
  - Algorithm 2 similarly contains no slack variable; instead it resets multipliers when ∥y_{k+1}∥ ≥ M_y by setting y_{k+1} = 0 (Block 48, lines 3–6).
- Problem:
  - The text asserts an inequality-to-equality transformation with s ≥ 0, but the mathematical definitions and code-like pseudocode omit s altogether and do not project Lagrange multipliers y onto R_{≥0} if inequalities are handled directly. This is a substantive inconsistency; it is unclear what optimization problem Algorithm 2 actually solves relative to the stated inequality-constrained problem (1)/(5).
  - The projection set 𝓧 in (11) is not defined for x alone when earlier X was defined as R^n × R_{≥0}^m (Block 18), creating ambiguity about what is being projected and where.

2) Neural network parameter count is inconsistent with the stated architecture
- Evidence:
  - Section 4.2 states: “a neural network with 2 interconnected hidden layers of sizes 64 and 32 … with a total of 194 parameters.” (Block 23).
- Problem:
  - With 9 input features, two fully connected layers of sizes 64 and 32, and a single output, the parameter count should be: 9×64 + 64 (bias) + 64×32 + 32 (bias) + 32×1 + 1 (bias) = 576+64+2048+32+32+1 = 2,753 parameters, not 194. No alternative architecture (e.g., extreme sparsity, shared weights) is described to justify 194. This is a large numerical mismatch that materially affects reproducibility and reported compute/variability.

3) Constraint level δ is never specified for the constrained problems
- Evidence:
  - The constrained ERM formulation (4) uses a two-sided bound ±δ on the loss-difference constraint (Block 9).
  - Section 4.2 “Problems” states they solve (4) but does not report δ (Block 23). Figures 1 and 2 captions speak of “constraint values” and show a “Constraint bound” line (Blocks 24–25), but the numeric value of δ is not given anywhere.
- Problem:
  - Without δ, it is impossible to judge constraint satisfaction, to reproduce the experiments, or to compare algorithms fairly. This is a material omission.
  - No direct evidence found in the manuscript providing the value of δ.

4) Contradiction between the narrative and Table 3 regarding sufficiency (Sf) for SGD-Fairret on test data
- Evidence:
  - Narrative: “SGD-Fairret slightly improves sufficiency relative to the SGD model.” and “Similar observations hold for metrics on the test set.” (Block 30).
  - Table 3 (Block 30): Test Sf = 0.180±0.022 for SGD-Fairret vs 0.171±0.009 for SGD (higher is worse; smaller is better per same paragraph).
- Problem:
  - The claim of improvement conflicts with the reported test results, and the statement that similar observations hold on the test set is incorrect for Sf.

5) Stochastic Ghost method: inconsistency in minibatch exponent notation in the core estimator
- Evidence:
  - Text describes sampling X_k^{2^{N+1}} and partitioning it into two minibatches of size 2^N (Block 16).
  - Equation (9) uses X_k^{2N+1} (without the exponent), while Algorithm 1 sets J = 2^{N+1} and refers to X_k^{2^{N+1}} (Blocks 17 and 47).
- Problem:
  - The mismatch between 2N+1 and 2^{N+1} in (9) vs text/algorithm is an internal inconsistency in the definition of the unbiased direction estimator, affecting correctness and reproducibility of StGh.

6) SSL-ALM multiplier handling is at odds with standard inequality treatments and with the stated slack-variable approach
- Evidence:
  - Algorithm 2 updates y_{k+1} = y_k + η c(x_k, ζ1), and if ∥y_{k+1}∥ ≥ M_y then y_{k+1} = 0 (Block 48, lines 3–6).
  - No projection of y onto R_{≥0} is performed; no slack variable appears (see Item 1).
- Problem:
  - If inequalities are enforced directly, standard AL/PD methods require y ≥ 0 (KKT), typically enforced via projection [implicit in the literature they cite]. If inequalities are converted to equalities via slack variables, the Lagrangian should include s and its update. The current description does neither, leaving the operative constraint treatment ambiguous.

7) SSw experimental setup omits required algorithmic hyperparameters
- Evidence:
  - Algorithm 3 requires mini-batch size J and a starting index k0 for recording outputs (Block 49).
  - Section 4.2 only reports η_k^f, η_k^c, and ε_k schedule for SSw; J and k0 are not provided (Block 23).
- Problem:
  - Missing required hyperparameters prevent reproduction and assessment of the reported SSw results.

8) Parameter λ is listed for Stochastic Ghost but not defined in the method
- Evidence:
  - Section 4.2 lists StGh parameters including “λ = 0.5” (Block 23).
  - Sections 3.2 and Algorithm 1 define/require p0, α0, α̂, ρ, τ, β (Blocks 16–18, 47); no λ appears.
- Problem:
  - Presence of an undefined parameter suggests either an undocumented modification of the method or a reporting error. This affects reproducibility.
  - No direct definition found in the manuscript for λ in StGh.

9) Binary decision rule for computing fairness metrics is unspecified
- Evidence:
  - Fairness metrics Ind/Sp/Sf (Blocks 11–13) require binary predictions ĤY.
  - Section 4.2 uses BCE-with-logits (Block 23) and reports prediction distributions (Figure 3; Blocks 30, 35–40), but the binarization threshold or rule for ĤY (e.g., 0.5 on σ(logits)) is not stated.
- Problem:
  - Different thresholds can materially change Ind/Sp/Sf; without a specified decision rule, the fairness metrics are not reproducible.
  - No direct evidence found in the manuscript of the threshold used.

10) Stratification description conflates group proportions with label rates
- Evidence:
  - “The dataset is split … stratified with respect to the protected attribute, i.e., the proportion of ‘white’ and ‘non-white’ samples … is equivalent to that in the full dataset (30.8% of positive labels in group ‘white’, 20.7% in ‘non-white’).” (Block 22).
- Problem:
  - The parenthetical percentages are label rates, not group proportions, creating confusion about what was stratified. While likely a reporting mix-up, it impacts clarity on data handling.

Summary assessment
- The most serious issues are the SSL-ALM inconsistency about inequality handling/slack variables and undefined projection set (Items 1 and 6), the large numerical mismatch in the network parameter count (Item 2), the missing constraint level δ (Item 3), and the contradiction between narrative and Table 3 for sufficiency on the test set (Item 4). Additional issues (Items 5, 7, 8, 9, 10) further impede reproducibility.
- These are high-impact, evidence-based inconsistencies that affect the trustworthiness and replicability of the reported methods and results.

If addressed, recommended actions
- Precisely specify the inequality treatment in SSL-ALM: either include and detail slack variables (with their updates and inclusion in Lρ and G) or explicitly define y-projections for inequalities; define 𝓧 unambiguously.
- Correct the network parameter count or fully describe the architecture (including any sparsity/tying) so the count matches the description.
- Report the exact δ used in all constrained runs (and show it in figure axes or captions).
- Align the narrative with Table 3 for test metrics or correct Table 3 if erroneous.
- Fix the 2^{N+1} vs 2N+1 notation in (9) to match Algorithm 1.
- Provide missing SSw hyperparameters (J, k0) and the prediction threshold used for fairness metrics.
- Define any extra parameters (e.g., λ in StGh) or remove if unused.
