Based on a critical review of the manuscript, the following report details clear internal inconsistencies and potential integrity risks that affect the scientific validity of the work.

### **Integrity Risk and Inconsistency Report**

**Summary of Findings:**
The manuscript contains several significant internal inconsistencies related to the number of algorithms benchmarked, the citation of a key method, and the correctness of a presented algorithm's pseudocode. These issues undermine the clarity and trustworthiness of the research contributions.

**1. Contradiction in the Number of Implemented Algorithms**

There is a direct contradiction between the Abstract, the list of contributions, and the experimental section regarding the number of new algorithms implemented and benchmarked.

*   **Evidence (Abstract):** The abstract states, "...we demonstrate the use of the benchmark by implementing and comparing **three** recently proposed, but as-of-yet unimplemented, algorithms..." (Block #2).
*   **Evidence (Contributions):** The contributions list in the Introduction states, "- a toolbox that (i) implements **four** algorithms applicable in real-world situations..." (Block #5).
*   **Evidence (Experiments):** Section 4.2, "Algorithms and parameters," explicitly lists and describes **four** algorithms for the constrained problem: "(1) Stochastic Ghost (StGh)..., (2) SSL-ALM..., (3) plain Augmented Lagrangian Method ALM..., and (4) Stochastic Switching Subgradient (SSw)..." (Block #23). The results presented in Figures 1, 2, 3 and Table 3 also consistently show results for these four algorithms.

**Conclusion:** The claim in the abstract (three algorithms) is factually incorrect and inconsistent with the rest of the manuscript (four algorithms). This discrepancy raises concerns about the care with which the manuscript was prepared.

**2. Citation of a Future-Dated Publication for a Core Method**

One of the central algorithms benchmarked, SSL-ALM, is attributed to a source with a future publication date.

*   **Evidence:** The Stochastic Smoothed and Linearized AL Method (SSL-ALM) is introduced in Section 3.3 and is a key part of the experimental comparison. The reference for this method is "[32] Ruichuan Huang, Jiawei Zhang, and Ahmet Alacaoglu. Stochastic smoothed primal-dual algorithms for nonconvex optimization with linear inequality constraints, **2025**." (Block #42).

**Conclusion:** Citing a paper with a publication date in the future is highly irregular. While it may refer to a preprint or an accepted paper, this practice is non-standard and lacks transparency. It makes it difficult for reviewers and readers to verify the source, understand the original context of the algorithm, and assess its novelty and correctness. This raises a significant concern about the verifiability of the claims made about this algorithm.

**3. Potential Error in Algorithm Pseudocode for Inequality Constraints**

The pseudocode for the SSL-ALM algorithm appears to be incorrect for handling the inequality constraints central to the paper's problem formulation.

*   **Evidence (Problem Formulation):** The paper addresses the constrained problem `min F(x) s.t. C(x) <= 0` (Block #14, Equation 5). This is a problem with inequality constraints.
*   **Evidence (Algorithm Pseudocode):** Algorithm 2 (Block #48) describes the update for the dual variable `y` as `y_{k+1} = y_k + η c(x_k, ζ1)` (line 3). This is the standard update for an *equality* constraint problem (`C(x) = 0`). For an *inequality* constraint, the dual variable must remain non-negative, which is typically enforced with a projection, such as `y_{k+1} = max(0, y_k + η c(x_k, ζ1))`.
*   **Evidence (Contradiction):** The pseudocode is missing this critical projection step. The text acknowledges adapting an algorithm for linear constraints to non-linear ones (Block #18) but fails to mention or justify this apparent deviation from the standard augmented Lagrangian method for inequalities.

**Conclusion:** The provided pseudocode for SSL-ALM (and by extension, the un-smoothed ALM) is inconsistent with the standard formulation for solving problems with inequality constraints. This suggests either the pseudocode is wrong or the implementation itself is flawed. If the implementation follows this pseudocode, the experimental results for the ALM and SSL-ALM methods may be invalid, as the algorithm would not be correctly solving the stated optimization problem. This is a substantive technical flaw that materially affects the paper's conclusions.
