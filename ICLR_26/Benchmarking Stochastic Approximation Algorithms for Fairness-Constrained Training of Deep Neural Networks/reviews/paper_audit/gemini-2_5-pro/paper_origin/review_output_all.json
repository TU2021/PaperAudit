  "baseline_review": "1) Summary\nThis paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating stochastic approximation algorithms on fairness-constrained deep neural network training tasks. The authors formulate fairness criteria, such as demographic parity, as constraints in an empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem. They provide a literature review of relevant constrained optimization algorithms, highlighting the theoretical challenges posed by non-convex, non-smooth, and stochastic objectives and constraints. The core contribution is a publicly released Python package that facilitates benchmarking on a large-scale dataset derived from US Census data (Folktables). The authors demonstrate the benchmark's utility by implementing and comparing three recent algorithms—Stochastic Ghost (StGh), Stochastic Smoothed and Linearized AL Method (SSL-ALM), and Stochastic Switching Subgradient (SSw)—evaluating their optimization performance and their effectiveness in improving fairness metrics.2) Strengths\n*   **Addresses a Timely and Important Problem**\n    *   The paper tackles the critical task of training machine learning models with explicit fairness constraints, which is of growing importance in both research and practice (Section 1, Section 2).\n    *   The motivation is well-grounded in real-world needs, referencing legislative frameworks like the EU AI Act and applications in high-risk domains (Section 1, Section 2).\n    *   By framing fairness as a constrained optimization problem (Equation 1, Table 1), the work connects the field of responsible AI with the established literature on stochastic optimization, providing a principled approach.*   **Significant Practical Contribution via a Public Benchmark and Toolbox**\n    *   The primary contribution is a reusable, open-source benchmark and Python package for comparing constrained optimization algorithms on fairness tasks (Abstract, Section 1).

The performance of these complex optimization algorithms is known to be highly sensitive to such choices.\n    *   The poor performance of the SSw method is explicitly linked to the choice of parameters, with the authors noting they \"were unable to identify parameter settings for SSw that simultaneously satisfy the constraints and minimize the objective function\" (Section 4.2). This raises questions about whether the comparison is entirely fair, as SSw may have been disadvantaged by a suboptimal parameter configuration.\n    *   The appendix shows that an alternative parameterization for SSw satisfies constraints but fails to minimize the objective (Appendix B, Figure 5), further highlighting the sensitivity and the lack of a systematic tuning process.*   **Mismatch Between Algorithm Assumptions and Problem Characteristics**\n    *   The paper correctly identifies that fairness-constrained ERM involves non-convex and potentially non-smooth functions (Section 3). However, the chosen algorithms are applied without a full discussion of how their theoretical assumptions are met or adapted.\n    *   Specifically, SSL-ALM was originally described for problems with *linear* constraints [32], but it is applied here to a problem with non-linear constraints derived from a neural network (Section 3.3).

If the implementation indeed omits the projection onto the non-negative orthant, please justify this choice or correct the pseudocode, as this step is critical for standard augmented Lagrangian methods on inequality-constrained problems.*   **Broaden the Set of Evaluated Algorithms**\n    *   To make the benchmark's initial results more impactful, consider including one or two additional, more standard constrained optimization baselines from the literature (e.g., a simple stochastic penalty method or a Lagrangian method like [42]). This would provide a more complete picture of the state of the art.\n    *   Please clarify the \"three\" vs. \"four\" algorithms statements in the abstract and introduction by explicitly noting that ALM is treated as a variant of SSL-ALM.*   **Enhance the Presentation of Figures**\n    *   Please revise Figures 1 and 2 to use a consistent y-axis scale for all loss plots (top row) to allow for direct visual comparison.\n    *   To improve the readability of the StGh plots, consider adding a smoothed trend line (e.g., using a moving average) over the noisy raw data to better visualize the convergence behavior.\n    *   Please correct the ordering of captions and text in Section 4.2 so that the text referencing each figure and table is followed directly by the corresponding element. A summary table reporting the mean and standard deviation of the final loss and constraint violation for each method could be a valuable addition to complement the time-series plots.5) Score\n*   Overall (10): 6 — The paper makes a valuable contribution with its benchmark, but the main empirical conclusion is weakened by a potential flaw in the implementation of the best-performing methods (Algorithm 2).\n*   Novelty (10): 7 — The primary novelty lies in the creation of a specific, open-source benchmark for fairness-constrained optimization and the comparative evaluation of recent algorithms on it (Abstract, Section 1).\n*   Technical Quality (10): 5 — The experimental setup is undermined by the lack of a clear hyperparameter tuning strategy and a potential error in the core dual update step for the best-performing algorithms (Algorithm 2, Appendix A).\n*   Clarity (10): 7 — The paper is generally well-written, but the presentation of results could be improved, particularly in the figures and the ordering of captions (Figures 1 & 2, Section 4.2).\n*   Confidence (5): 5 — I am highly confident in my assessment, as my expertise aligns well with the topics of optimization, fairness, and benchmarking in machine learning."
