      "strength": "Both reviews emphasize very similar core motivations and contributions. They agree that the key contribution is a comprehensive benchmark, MIKASA, targeting memory in RL and especially in robotic manipulation, consisting of MIKASA-Base and MIKASA-Robo. Both highlight the four-way taxonomy (object, spatial, sequential, capacity) as an important structuring contribution. They both stress real-world relevance via robotic manipulation and partial observability, and they both note the extensive empirical evaluation across online RL, offline RL, and VLA models, with results showing that current methods struggle on memory-intensive tasks. They also align on practical strengths: use of ManiSkill3 for scalable simulation, availability of code, datasets, and good documentation that facilitate adoption and reproducibility. The AI review adds more granular detail (e.g., specific algorithms, figures, appendices), but this deepens rather than diverges from the human review’s described strengths.",
      "weakness": "There is partial but not complete overlap in identified weaknesses. Strong overlap: both note limited coverage of advanced/strong memory architectures (the human mentions insufficient evaluation of large models like Octo/OpenVLA; the AI reviews repeatedly raise the omission of more sophisticated memory architectures beyond LSTM/DT/RATE). Both also flag the sim-to-real gap / absence of real-robot validation and limited discussion of sim-to-real robustness. Areas where alignment is weaker: the human reviewer emphasizes domain-specific limitations (scope restricted to tabletop pick-and-place style tasks, some tasks being too simple, lack of diagnostic tools beyond success rates, limited depth of cognitive grounding of the taxonomy), whereas the AI reviews focus more on methodological/metric issues (no quantitative per-task memory metrics like correlation horizon, perception–memory confounds not ablated, offline datasets being generated from state-mode policies causing distribution shift, lack of generalization tests). These concerns are related in spirit (limitations of the benchmark design and evaluation depth), but they are not the same concrete points. Hence, weaknesses are only moderately aligned rather than tightly overlapping.",
      "overall": "In aggregate, the two reviews are substantially aligned on the big picture: both see MIKASA as a timely, well-engineered, and practically useful benchmark suite that fills an important gap in memory evaluation for RL and robotic manipulation, with a strong taxonomy, broad task coverage, and extensive but not exhaustive empirical validation. Both judge that current methods struggle on these tasks and that the work is impactful and infrastructural, while also recognizing that the evaluation could be broadened (e.g., stronger memory models, real-world experiments, more nuanced analysis of failure modes). Differences lie mainly in the level of granularity and specific criticisms: the human review foregrounds scope (tabletop limitation, task simplicity) and lack of diagnostic tools, while the AI reviews emphasize more technical desiderata (quantitative memory metrics, ablations on perception vs memory, dataset biases). Because these are complementary rather than contradictory, the overall substantive judgment and focus are fairly well aligned, though not perfectly coincident."

          "strength": "Both reviews agree that the main contribution is a comprehensive benchmark (MIKASA-Base and MIKASA-Robo) focused on memory in RL/robotic manipulation, structured by a four-way memory taxonomy and backed by broad empirical evaluation showing current methods struggle. They both highlight real-world/robotics relevance, the ManiSkill3-based scalable implementation, and strong documentation/usability. Review B adds more granularity (observation modes, reward regimes, offline datasets) but these are consistent extensions, not contradictory points.",
          "weakness": "Both mention limited real-world/physical-robot validation and sim-to-real considerations as an important gap, and both note incomplete treatment of memory mechanisms/cognitive grounding (A: shallow cognitive link; B: taxonomy not empirically validated, overlapping categories). Review A focuses more on scope limitations (only tabletop, task simplicity, lack of diagnostic tools, limited evaluation of large models), while Review B emphasizes different technical concerns (baseline breadth, memory–perception confounds, offline dataset design, metric/reporting inconsistencies); these do not conflict but only partially overlap.",
          "overall": "The reviews share a clear common view of what the paper is about and why it matters: a well-engineered, comprehensive memory benchmark for RL/robotics with a useful taxonomy and extensive experiments, but with gaps in empirical validation of memory constructs and in demonstrating real-world relevance. Divergences lie mainly in the secondary critiques each reviewer emphasizes, not in core evaluation or judgment, leading to high but not perfect substantive alignment."
