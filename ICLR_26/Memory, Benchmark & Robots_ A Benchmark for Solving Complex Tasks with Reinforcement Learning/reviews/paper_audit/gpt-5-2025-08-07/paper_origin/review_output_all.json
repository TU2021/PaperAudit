  "baseline_review": "Summary\n- The paper introduces MIKASA, a unified framework for benchmarking memory-intensive reinforcement learning (RL), with two concrete suites: MIKASA-Base (a Gymnasium-based consolidation of existing memory environments) and MIKASA-Robo (32 tabletop robotic manipulation tasks explicitly designed to require memory). The authors propose a four-class taxonomy of memory tasks (object, spatial, sequential, capacity) (Section 4.2), implement multiple observation modes and reward regimes (dense/sparse) for robotic tasks (Section 6.1; Table 1), and release offline datasets (Appendix B). Experiments demonstrate that tasks are solvable in fully observed “state” mode (Figures 4, 7, 8), but standard online RL (PPO-MLP, PPO-LSTM; SAC; TD-MPC2), offline RL (RATE, DT, BC, CQL, DP) and VLA models (Octo, OpenVLA) struggle under partial observability and sparse rewards (Figures 5, 9, 10; Table 6; Table 4), supporting the benchmark’s difficulty and memory demands.Strengths\n- Bold and useful taxonomy linking cognitive memory constructs to RL\n  • The four-type taxonomy (Object, Spatial, Sequential, Capacity) is clearly articulated (Section 4.2) and motivated by cognitive science concepts (Section 4.1; Figure 3), improving conceptual clarity for designing and evaluating memory tasks (clarity, impact).\n  • The taxonomy is used to categorize both new robotic tasks (Table 1; Section 6.1) and consolidated base environments (Table 7; Section 5), enabling systematic coverage across diverse memory skills (novelty in unification, clarity).\n  • Figure 1 highlights the motivation—fragmentation and incomparable evaluations—addressed by taxonomy-based separation (impact).- Comprehensive, well-scoped robotic benchmark with 32 tasks and multi-difficulty variants\n  • MIKASA-Robo covers 12 categories with difficulty modes that target distinct memory skills (Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12), supporting granular assessment (experimental rigor, impact).\n  • Multiple observation modes (state, RGB, joints, oracle, prompt) and reward regimes (dense, sparse) are implemented (Section 6.1), enabling controlled manipulation of partial observability and feedback (technical soundness).\n  • Detailed per-task descriptions, success criteria, and reward designs (Appendix H with Figures 11–22) improve reproducibility and facilitate independent validation (clarity, practical utility).- Unified access to diverse memory environments via MIKASA-Base\n  • The consolidation of open-source memory tasks under a single Gymnasium-like API (Section 5; Appendix C, Code 3) directly addresses evaluation fragmentation (impact, clarity).\n  • The curated classification of MIKASA-Base environments into the four memory types (Table 7) offers a clear bridge between conceptual taxonomy and practical evaluation (novelty in standardization).\n  • Tiered design principles (diagnostic vector tasks vs complex image tasks) (Section 5) allow isolating memory from perception challenges incrementally (technical soundness).- Strong empirical validation of benchmark difficulty and memory dependence\n  • Tasks are solvable with PPO-MLP in fully observed “state” mode (Figures 4, 7, 8), ruling out mis-specified goals and affirming task solvability (experimental rigor).\n  • Under RGB+joints and dense rewards, PPO-LSTM outperforms PPO-MLP on simpler settings (e.g., RememberColor3-v0) but both degrade with increasing complexity (Figures 5, 9), evidencing growing memory demands (technical soundness).\n  • Sparse reward settings are demonstrably hard across many tasks (Figure 10; Appendix F), aligning with real-world low-feedback conditions (impact).- Breadth of baselines: online RL, offline RL, and VLA models\n  • Online RL: PPO-MLP vs PPO-LSTM, SAC, TD-MPC2 (Section 6.2; Figures 5, 9), showing that common robotics algorithms without explicit memory struggle under partial observability (experimental rigor).\n  • Offline RL: RATE, DT, BC, CQL, DP evaluated across all 32 tasks with sparse rewards (Section 6.3; Table 6; Figure 6/27), revealing strong challenges especially for capacity/sequential tasks (impact).\n  • VLA: Octo and OpenVLA on selected tasks (Section 6.4; Table 4), demonstrating degradation with complexity and limitations of chunking vs true memory (novelty in cross-paradigm evaluation).- Clear documentation, tooling, and reproducibility support\n  • Wrappers and debugging utilities (Appendix A; Code 2), explicit environment info overlays (Appendix A), and pip install note for MIKASA-Robo (^1; Introduction) enhance usability (clarity, impact).\n  • Offline dataset specification (Appendix B) with trajectory structure and availability encourages standardized evaluation (reproducibility).\n  • Compute setup, seeds, and evaluation protocols (Appendix G) further support reproducible experimentation (experimental rigor).- Articulated gap in robotics memory evaluation and principled benchmark design\n  • Comparative analysis with existing robotics frameworks (Table 3; Section 6) clarifies that MIKASA-Robo addresses atomic, low-level, memory-centric manipulation, unlike many existing suites (novelty, impact).\n  • The design rationale for isolating memory mechanisms rather than conflating with high-level abstractions (Section 6; Table 3) is sound and useful to the community (technical soundness).Weaknesses\n- Limited empirical validation of the taxonomy beyond use as organizing principle\n  • The taxonomy (Section 4.2) is described but not quantitatively validated for separability or coverage; the paper does not provide measures indicating that tasks exclusively stress one type of memory (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (novelty/technical soundness).\n  • Potential overlap across categories (e.g., ShellGame—object permanence with spatial localization) is not analyzed for cross-category leakage (Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12), risking ambiguity in conclusions (clarity).\n  • While cognitive science motivates the taxonomy (Section 4.1; Figure 3), there is no alignment with cognitive diagnostics or metrics that could strengthen validation (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (technical soundness).- Baseline coverage for online RL is narrow relative to the stated landscape\n  • Online baselines use LSTM as the sole explicit memory module (Section 6.2), omitting widely cited transformer/SSM-based agents (e.g., GTrXL, HCAM, S5) listed in Table 2, limiting generality of conclusions (experimental rigor/novelty).\n  • Off-policy baselines (SAC, TD-MPC2) are included without recurrent or memory-augmented variants (Section 6.2), weakening the claim about “inappropriateness of algorithms common in robotics” under memory demands (technical soundness).\n  • Hyperparameter sensitivity or capacity sweeps for LSTM/MLP are not reported (Figures 5, 9), making it hard to rule out configuration-induced failures (experimental rigor).- Memory vs perception confounds not fully disentangled or quantified\n  • The correlation horizon ξ is defined (Section 3.2) but not reported per task (Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12), limiting quantification of memory demands (technical soundness).\n  • Performance drops with more colors/shapes (Figures 5, 9) could reflect increasing visual discrimination difficulty rather than memory per se; no ablation with identical perception complexity but reduced memory requirements (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (novelty/clarity).\n  • Although tiering (Section 5) is proposed, there are no cross-tier ablations connecting vector diagnostics to image tasks for the same underlying memory construct (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (experimental rigor).- Offline dataset design choices may bias or limit conclusions\n  • Datasets contain only successful trajectories (Appendix B), which may reduce diversity and limit the utility of offline RL algorithms that benefit from varied returns (technical quality).\n  • Trajectories are collected in fully observed “state” mode but used to train on RGB observations (Appendix B; Section 6.3), introducing a modality mismatch that may confound learning (experimental rigor).\n  • Dataset size (1000 per task) and train/validation/test splits or cross-task generalization protocols are not detailed (Appendix B), making it difficult to interpret negative results (clarity).- Metrics and reporting inconsistencies hinder comparability\n  • Mixture of Return and Success Rate across figures (Figures 5 vs. 9/10) can complicate cross-task and cross-method comparisons (clarity).\n  • No explicit random or heuristic baselines shown in figures to contextualize performance statements (Section 6.4 mentions “exceeds random” but Table 4 does not present random baselines) (clarity/experimental rigor).\n  • Training budgets and evaluation horizons differ across tasks (Figures 7–9, 10), and normalization across tasks/methods is not described (Appendix G covers evaluation seeds but not budget normalization), affecting fairness (experimental rigor).- No physical-robot validation or sim-to-real analysis despite real-world motivation\n  • All experiments are in simulation (ManiSkill3) (Section 6; [87]) with no hardware results (No direct evidence found in the manuscript), limiting claims of real-world readiness (impact/technical soundness).\n  • Reward shaping and success definitions may not directly translate to physical constraints (Appendix H), and there are no domain randomization or robustness tests to support sim-to-real transfer (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (experimental rigor).\n  • Although the benchmark targets practical memory needs (Introduction; Section 6), there is no demonstration of robustness to sensory noise, latency, or calibration drift typical in hardware (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (impact).Suggestions for Improvement\n- Strengthen empirical validation of the taxonomy\n  • Provide quantitative metrics of task-category separability (e.g., controlled task variants that isolate a single type) and report per-task memory attribution scores; add an ablation showing cross-category leakage (Section 4.2; Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12).\n  • Analyze ambiguous tasks (e.g., ShellGame) for dual-memory demands via controlled variants (object vs spatial emphasis) and report results (Table 1; H.1).\n  • Include alignment with cognitive diagnostics (e.g., memory span or object permanence analogs), specifying measurement protocols and reporting outcomes (Section 4.1; Figure 3).- Expand baseline coverage and configuration analysis for online RL\n  • Add transformer/SSM-based memory baselines representative of Table 2 (e.g., GTrXL, HCAM, S5) on a subset spanning all four categories to test generality (Section 6.2; Table 2).\n  • Evaluate recurrent/off-policy baselines (e.g., SAC+RNN, TD-MPC2 with memory) to fairly test claims about robotics algorithms under memory demands (Section 6.2).\n  • Report sensitivity analyses (hidden sizes, sequence lengths, learning rates) and training-time budgets to ensure failures are not configuration-driven (Figures 5, 9; Appendix G).- Disentangle perception from memory requirements with targeted ablations and quantification\n  • Annotate each task with estimated correlation horizon ξ (Section 3.2) and provide controlled experiments showing performance variation with ξ while keeping perception constant (Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12).\n  • Create perception-controlled variants (e.g., identical colors/shapes but varying occlusion/delay) and compare to memory-controlled variants (varying sequence length/capacity) to isolate which dimension drives failures (Figures 5, 9).\n  • Link vector diagnostics from MIKASA-Base (Table 7) to matched image tasks (MIKASA-Robo) via shared structure, and report cross-tier correlations (Section 5).- Improve offline dataset design and reporting to support stronger conclusions\n  • Include mixed-return datasets (successful and unsuccessful trajectories) and report how success rate composition affects offline RL performance (Appendix B; Section 6.3).\n  • Reduce modality mismatch by also collecting RGB trajectories under RGB policy execution; optionally provide paired state/RGB datasets for controlled comparisons (Appendix B).\n  • Specify train/validation/test splits, random seeds, and cross-task generalization protocols; consider scaling dataset sizes and reporting sample-efficiency curves (Appendix B; Table 6).- Standardize metrics and baselines for clearer comparisons\n  • Use a consistent primary metric (e.g., Success Rate) across all figures and include secondary metrics in appendices; add random and simple heuristic baselines for context (Figures 5, 9, 10; Table 4).\n  • Normalize training budgets (steps, wall-clock, environment interactions) across methods and tasks; report a standardized evaluation horizon and confidence intervals throughout (Appendix G; Figures 7–10).\n  • Provide per-task difficulty indices (e.g., by ξ, number of distractors, occlusion duration) to allow nuanced comparisons across methods and tasks (Table 1; Appendices H).- Add at least preliminary real-world validation or sim-to-real robustness experiments\n  • Demonstrate a subset of tasks on a physical tabletop setup (e.g., RememberColor3, ShellGameTouch) and report transfer gaps and failure modes (Section 6; Appendices H).\n  • Incorporate domain randomization and noise (camera, actuation, latency) and show robustness analyses to support real-world claims (Appendix H; Section 6.1).\n  • Compare reward/shaping alternatives that better reflect hardware constraints (e.g., contact uncertainty) and report impacts on learning (Appendix H; Section 6.1).Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Strong benchmark contribution with clear taxonomy and extensive tasks (Section 4.2; Table 1; Table 7) and thorough empirical validation of difficulty (Figures 5, 9, 10; Table 6), but limited baseline breadth and taxonomy quantification reduce the overall strength.\n- Novelty (10): 7 — Novel unification of memory tasks across RL and robotics (Section 5; Section 6; Table 3), plus a four-type taxonomy (Section 4.2), though taxonomy validation and overlap analysis are limited.\n- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Solid engineering and reproducibility (Appendix A–C, G) and careful solvability checks (Figures 4, 7, 8), but memory–perception confounds and narrow baselines (Section 6.2) constrain technical depth.\n- Clarity (10): 8 — Clear task descriptions and APIs (Appendix H; Appendix C; Code snippets), detailed tables/figures (Table 1; Table 7; Figures 11–22), with minor metric/reporting inconsistencies (Figures 5 vs 9/10).\n- Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence based on detailed manuscript, extensive appendices, and multiple experiments (Sections 6.2–6.4; Appendix F/G), with some uncertainty due to missing taxonomy validation and hardware tests.",

Appendices H.1–H.12), supporting granular assessment (experimental rigor, impact).\n  • Multiple observation modes (state, RGB, joints, oracle, prompt) and reward regimes (dense, sparse) are implemented (Section 6.1), enabling controlled manipulation of partial observability and feedback (technical soundness).\n  • Detailed per-task descriptions, success criteria, and reward designs (Appendix H with Figures 11–22) improve reproducibility and facilitate independent validation (clarity, practical utility).- Unified access to diverse memory environments via MIKASA-Base\n  • The consolidation of open-source memory tasks under a single Gymnasium-like API (Section 5; Appendix C, Code 3) directly addresses evaluation fragmentation (impact, clarity).\n  • The curated classification of MIKASA-Base environments into the four memory types (Table 7) offers a clear bridge between conceptual taxonomy and practical evaluation (novelty in standardization).\n  • Tiered design principles (diagnostic vector tasks vs complex image tasks) (Section 5) allow isolating memory from perception challenges incrementally (technical soundness).- Strong empirical validation of benchmark difficulty and memory dependence\n  • Tasks are solvable with PPO-MLP in fully observed “state” mode (Figures 4, 7, 8), indicating inherent task solvability; success rates often approach 1.0, though some plots end below 1.0 (e.g., InterceptSlow, ShellGamePush, InterceptFast in Appendix F; Figures 49, 54, 69), which still supports the solvability claim (experimental rigor).\n  • Under RGB+joints and dense rewards, PPO-LSTM outperforms PPO-MLP on simpler settings (e.g., RememberColor3-v0) but both degrade with increasing complexity (Figures 5, 9), evidencing growing memory demands (technical soundness).\n  • Sparse reward settings are demonstrably hard across many tasks (Figure 10; Appendix F), aligning with real-world low-feedback conditions (impact).- Breadth of baselines: online RL, offline RL, and VLA models\n  • Online RL: PPO-MLP vs PPO-LSTM, SAC, TD-MPC2 (Section 6.2; Figures 5, 9), showing that common robotics algorithms without explicit memory struggle under partial observability (experimental rigor).\n  • Offline RL: RATE, DT, BC, CQL, DP evaluated across all 32 tasks with sparse rewards (Section 6.3; Table 6; Figure 6/27), revealing strong challenges especially for capacity/sequential tasks (impact).\n  • VLA: Octo and OpenVLA on selected tasks (Section 6.4; Table 4), demonstrating degradation with complexity and limitations of chunking vs true memory (novelty in cross-paradigm evaluation).- Clear documentation, tooling, and reproducibility support\n  • Wrappers and debugging utilities (Appendix A; Code 2), explicit environment info overlays (Appendix A), and pip install note for MIKASA-Robo (^1; Introduction) enhance usability (clarity, impact).\n  • Offline dataset specification (Appendix B) with trajectory structure and availability encourages standardized evaluation (reproducibility).\n  • Compute setup, seeds, and evaluation protocols (Appendix G) further support reproducible experimentation (experimental rigor).- Articulated gap in robotics memory evaluation and principled benchmark design\n  • Comparative analysis with existing robotics frameworks (Table 3; Section 6) clarifies that MIKASA-Robo addresses atomic, low-level, memory-centric manipulation, unlike many existing suites (novelty, impact).\n  • The design rationale for isolating memory mechanisms rather than conflating with high-level abstractions (Section 6; Table 3) is sound and useful to the community (technical soundness).Weaknesses\n- Limited empirical validation of the taxonomy beyond use as organizing principle\n  • The taxonomy (Section 4.2) is described but not quantitatively validated for separability or coverage; the paper does not provide measures indicating that tasks exclusively stress one type of memory (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (novelty/technical soundness).\n  • Potential overlap across categories (e.g., ShellGame—object permanence with spatial localization) is not analyzed for cross-category leakage (Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12), risking ambiguity in conclusions (clarity).\n  • While cognitive science motivates the taxonomy (Section 4.1; Figure 3), there is no alignment with cognitive diagnostics or metrics that could strengthen validation (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (technical soundness).- Baseline coverage for online RL is narrow relative to the stated landscape\n  • Online baselines use LSTM as the sole explicit memory module (Section 6.2), omitting widely cited transformer/SSM-based agents (e.g., GTrXL, HCAM, S5) listed in Table 2, limiting generality of conclusions (experimental rigor/novelty).\n  • Off-policy baselines (SAC, TD-MPC2) are included without recurrent or memory-augmented variants (Section 6.2), weakening the claim about “inappropriateness of algorithms common in robotics” under memory demands (technical soundness).\n  • Hyperparameter sensitivity or capacity sweeps for LSTM/MLP are not reported (Figures 5, 9), making it hard to rule out configuration-induced failures (experimental rigor).- Memory vs perception confounds not fully disentangled or quantified\n  • The correlation horizon ξ is defined (Section 3.2) but not reported per task (Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12), limiting quantification of memory demands (technical soundness).\n  • Performance drops with more colors/shapes (Figures 5, 9) could reflect increasing visual discrimination difficulty rather than memory per se; no ablation with identical perception complexity but reduced memory requirements (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (novelty/clarity).\n  • Although tiering (Section 5) is proposed, there are no cross-tier ablations connecting vector diagnostics to image tasks for the same underlying memory construct (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (experimental rigor).- Offline dataset design choices may bias or limit conclusions\n  • Datasets contain only successful trajectories (Appendix B), which may reduce diversity and limit the utility of offline RL algorithms that benefit from varied returns (technical quality).\n  • Trajectories are collected in fully observed “state” mode but used to train on RGB observations (Appendix B; Section 6.3), introducing a modality mismatch that may confound learning (experimental rigor).\n  • Dataset size (1000 per task) and train/validation/test splits or cross-task generalization protocols are not detailed (Appendix B), making it difficult to interpret negative results (clarity).\n  • The claim that datasets were collected with “SR = 100% … with sparse rewards” (Appendix B) is not supported by direct evidence of 100% SR under sparse rewards in figures/tables; Appendix F discusses 100% under dense rewards in state mode (Appendix B; Appendix F; No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (reproducibility).- Metrics and reporting inconsistencies hinder comparability\n  • Mixture of Return and Success Rate across figures (Figures 5 vs. 9/10) can complicate cross-task and cross-method comparisons (clarity).\n  • No explicit random or heuristic baselines shown in figures to contextualize performance statements (Section 6.4 mentions “exceeds random” but Table 4 does not present random baselines) (clarity/experimental rigor).\n  • Training budgets and evaluation horizons differ across tasks (Figures 7–9, 10), and normalization across tasks/methods is not described (Appendix G covers evaluation seeds but not budget normalization), affecting fairness (experimental rigor).- No physical-robot validation or sim-to-real analysis despite real-world motivation\n  • All experiments are in simulation (ManiSkill3) (Section 6; [87]) with no hardware results (No direct evidence found in the manuscript), limiting claims of real-world readiness (impact/technical soundness).\n  • Reward shaping and success definitions may not directly translate to physical constraints (Appendix H), and there are no domain randomization or robustness tests to support sim-to-real transfer (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (experimental rigor).\n  • Although the benchmark targets practical memory needs (Introduction; Section 6), there is no demonstration of robustness to sensory noise, latency, or calibration drift typical in hardware (No direct evidence found in the manuscript) (impact).- Cross-referencing and internal consistency issues\n  • Figure numbering and cross-references appear inconsistent: “Figure 2” is used to illustrate task executions from MIKASA-Robo (Preliminaries; Figure 2 caption) while the matrix of prior evaluations (Preliminaries; image) is not clearly numbered, hindering traceability (clarity).\n  • Table 2 contains multiple citation-number mismatches relative to the References list (e.g., GTrXL labeled “[26]” while [72] corresponds to Stabilizing Transformers for RL; AMAGO labeled “[72]” while AMAGO is [26]; RATE labeled “[77]” though RATE is [10]; Neural Map labeled “[62]” though Neural Map is [71]; R2D2 labeled “[71]” though R2D2 is [45]) (Table 2; References), affecting scholarly integrity and verifiability (impact/clarity).\n  • Episode timeouts for RememberColor differ between definitions and code (Table 1 lists T=60; Appendix D Table 5 lists T=60; Appendix A Code 1 uses episode_timeout=90 for RememberColor9-v0), without reconciliation (Table 1; Appendix D; Appendix A), which can impede reproducibility (experimental rigor).Suggestions for Improvement\n- Strengthen empirical validation of the taxonomy\n  • Provide quantitative metrics of task-category separability (e.g., controlled task variants that isolate a single type) and report per-task memory attribution scores; add an ablation showing cross-category leakage (Section 4.2; Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12).\n  • Analyze ambiguous tasks (e.g., ShellGame) for dual-memory demands via controlled variants (object vs spatial emphasis) and report results (Table 1; H.1).\n  • Include alignment with cognitive diagnostics (e.g., memory span or object permanence analogs), specifying measurement protocols and reporting outcomes (Section 4.1; Figure 3).- Expand baseline coverage and configuration analysis for online RL\n  • Add transformer/SSM-based memory baselines representative of Table 2 (e.g., GTrXL, HCAM, S5) on a subset spanning all four categories to test generality (Section 6.2; Table 2).\n  • Evaluate recurrent/off-policy baselines (e.g., SAC+RNN, TD-MPC2 with memory) to fairly test claims about robotics algorithms under memory demands (Section 6.2).\n  • Report sensitivity analyses (hidden sizes, sequence lengths, learning rates) and training-time budgets to ensure failures are not configuration-driven (Figures 5, 9; Appendix G).- Disentangle perception from memory requirements with targeted ablations and quantification\n  • Annotate each task with estimated correlation horizon ξ (Section 3.2) and provide controlled experiments showing performance variation with ξ while keeping perception constant (Table 1; Appendices H.1–H.12).\n  • Create perception-controlled variants (e.g., identical colors/shapes but varying occlusion/delay) and compare to memory-controlled variants (varying sequence length/capacity) to isolate which dimension drives failures (Figures 5, 9).\n  • Link vector diagnostics from MIKASA-Base (Table 7) to matched image tasks (MIKASA-Robo) via shared structure, and report cross-tier correlations (Section 5).- Improve offline dataset design and reporting to support stronger conclusions\n  • Include mixed-return datasets (successful and unsuccessful trajectories) and report how success rate composition affects offline RL performance (Appendix B; Section 6.3).\n  • Reduce modality mismatch by also collecting RGB trajectories under RGB policy execution; optionally provide paired state/RGB datasets for controlled comparisons (Appendix B).\n  • Specify train/validation/test splits, random seeds, and cross-task generalization protocols; consider scaling dataset sizes and reporting sample-efficiency curves (Appendix B; Table 6).\n  • Substantiate the “SR = 100% … with sparse rewards” dataset-collection claim by adding plots/tables demonstrating 100% SR under sparse rewards in state mode across tasks, or revise the claim to match available evidence (Appendix B; Appendix F).- Standardize metrics and baselines for clearer comparisons\n  • Use a consistent primary metric (e.g., Success Rate) across all figures and include secondary metrics in appendices; add random and simple heuristic baselines for context (Figures 5, 9, 10; Table 4).\n  • Normalize training budgets (steps, wall-clock, environment interactions) across methods and tasks; report a standardized evaluation horizon and confidence intervals throughout (Appendix G; Figures 7–10).\n  • Provide per-task difficulty indices (e.g., by ξ, number of distractors, occlusion duration) to allow nuanced comparisons across methods and tasks (Table 1; Appendices H).- Add at least preliminary real-world validation or sim-to-real robustness experiments\n  • Demonstrate a subset of tasks on a physical tabletop setup (e.g., RememberColor3, ShellGameTouch) and report transfer gaps and failure modes (Section 6; Appendices H).\n  • Incorporate domain randomization and noise (camera, actuation, latency) and show robustness analyses to support real-world claims (Appendix H; Section 6.1).\n  • Compare reward/shaping alternatives that better reflect hardware constraints (e.g., contact uncertainty) and report impacts on learning (Appendix H; Section 6.1).- Ensure internal consistency and correct citations\n  • Fix figure numbering/cross-references so each figure is uniquely identified and referenced consistently (Preliminaries; Figure 2 caption; Preliminaries image).\n  • Correct method/environment citation numbers in Table 2 to match the References list (e.g., GTrXL [72], AMAGO [26], RATE [10], Neural Map [71], R2D2 [45]) and add any missing entries (Table 2; References).\n  • Reconcile episode timeouts (e.g., RememberColor T=60 in Table 1 and Appendix D vs episode_timeout=90 in Appendix A Code 1); clarify default vs evaluation settings and update code snippets/documentation accordingly (Table 1; Appendix D; Appendix A).Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Strong benchmark and taxonomy with broad task coverage (Section 4.2; Table 1; Table 7) and multi-paradigm baselines showing difficulty (Figures 5, 9, 10; Table 6), tempered by narrow online baselines and internal consistency/citation issues (Table 2; Appendix A/B).\n- Novelty (10): 7 — Novel unification across memory tasks and robotics with a four-type taxonomy (Section 5; Section 6; Table 3; Section 4.2), though the taxonomy lacks quantitative validation (Section 4.2; Appendices H.1–H.12).\n- Technical Quality (10): 5 — Solid engineering and reproducibility (Appendix A–C, G) and state-mode solvability evidence (Figures 4, 7, 8) but memory–perception confounds (Section 3.2; Figures 5, 9), narrow baselines (Section 6.2), and citation/consistency issues (Table 2; Appendix A/B) lower confidence.\n- Clarity (10): 7 — Clear task/API documentation and detailed appendices (Appendix H; Appendix C; Code snippets; Table 1; Table 7; Figures 11–22), with comparability and cross-referencing inconsistencies (Figures 5 vs 9/10; Preliminaries Figure 2; Table 2 citation numbers).\n- Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence from extensive experiments and detailed appendices (Sections 6.2–6.4; Appendix F/G), with uncertainty stemming from missing taxonomy validation and internal citation/consistency issues (Section 4.2; Table 2; Appendix A/B)."
