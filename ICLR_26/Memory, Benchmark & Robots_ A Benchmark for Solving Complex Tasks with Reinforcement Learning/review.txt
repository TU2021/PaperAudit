### Summary

The paper introduces **MIKASA (Memory-Intensive Skills Assessment Suite for Agents)**, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate memory mechanisms in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in the context of **robotic manipulation**. The proposed benchmark includes **MIKASA-Base**, which integrates multiple existing memory-intensive tasks, and **MIKASA-Robo**, a suite of 32 tasks that test **temporal** and **spatial memory** required for real-world robotic tasks. The tasks span four categories of memory: **object memory**, **spatial memory**, **sequential memory**, and **memory capacity**. The authors show that current RL models struggle with memory-intensive tasks, underscoring the need for better memory mechanisms.

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Benchmark**:

   * The proposed benchmark is well-structured and provides **robust coverage** of different memory tasks. It fills a crucial gap in RL research by offering a comprehensive set of tasks that specifically target memory capabilities.

2. **Structured Memory Categorization**:

   * The **four-category memory classification** (object, spatial, sequential, and memory capacity) is a novel contribution, helping researchers systematically evaluate various memory requirements in robotic manipulation.

3. **Real-World Relevance**:

   * The paper¡¯s **motivation** is rooted in real-world challenges, highlighting the need for memory in robotic manipulation tasks with partial observability and long-horizon dependencies.

4. **Extensive Empirical Evaluation**:

   * The benchmark is validated through a series of **empirical evaluations** using multiple baselines (online RL, offline RL, and imitation learning), showing consistent results and performance gaps that need addressing.

5. **Scalability**:

   * The tasks are built on the **ManiSkill3 simulation engine**, which allows **GPU parallelization** for scalable experimentation.

6. **Codebase and Usability**:

   * The codebase is **well-documented** and includes a starter notebook, lowering the barrier for adoption and usage in RL research.

### Weaknesses

1. **Limited to Tabletop Robotic Manipulation**:

   * The benchmark is currently **specialized** for tabletop tasks like **pick-and-place**, which limits its general applicability. The scope of robotic tasks could be expanded to include more **real-world scenarios**, such as **dual-arm coordination** or **complex object retrieval**.

2. **No Real-World Evaluation (Initially)**:

   * The initial evaluation focused **only on simulation**, which limits the generalizability of the results to real-world robotics. However, the authors later added **real-world experiments** to address this concern.

3. **Sim2Real Gap**:

   * The paper does not address the **sim-to-real gap** sufficiently. Although the authors claim the framework can be adapted for real-world applications, the lack of empirical **real-world results** in the initial version reduced the persuasive value of the benchmark.

4. **Memory Mechanism Complexity**:

   * The framework does not fully explore **cognitive processes** and **memory mechanisms**. While the categorization is useful, it could benefit from a deeper connection to real-world cognitive processes or more specific memory demands in robotics.

5. **Task Simplicity**:

   * Some of the tasks, particularly those involving **object manipulation** (e.g., **color sorting**), are **too simplistic** and may not adequately reflect the complexities involved in real-world tasks like **multi-step assembly** or **complex grasping**.

6. **Lack of Diagnostic Tools**:

   * The paper mainly reports **success rates** without offering enough diagnostic tools to identify the root cause of failures (e.g., memory decay, perception errors). This makes it harder to pinpoint where the memory system is failing.

7. **Insufficient Evaluation of Large Models**:

   * The evaluation of large models like **Octo** and **OpenVLA** was limited due to **computational constraints**, which might impact the **fairness** and **depth** of model comparison. A more thorough evaluation of large-scale models is needed to validate their memory capabilities comprehensively.
