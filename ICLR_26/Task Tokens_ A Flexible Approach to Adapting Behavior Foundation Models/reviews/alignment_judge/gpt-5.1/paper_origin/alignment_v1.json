      "strength": "Both reviews are highly aligned on the core motivation and contributions. They both describe Task Tokens as a parameter-efficient task encoder that produces a small task-specific token to condition a frozen behavior foundation model (MaskedMimic / GC-BFM) trained via RL (PPO). Both emphasize: (1) keeping the BFM frozen to avoid catastrophic forgetting and preserve natural motion priors; (2) the small size (~200k parameters) and modularity of the task encoder; (3) strong empirical performance across several humanoid control tasks; (4) robustness to OOD perturbations in friction/gravity; (5) human-likeness of the resulting motions as supported by a human study; and (6) the ability to combine multi-modal priors (e.g., joint conditioning, text) with learned tokens. The AI review adds more implementation and evaluation detail (e.g., specific baselines and figures), but the high-level strengths and motivation it highlights closely match those in the human review.",
      "weakness": "The weaknesses show much less overlap. The human review focuses on: (1) possible overstatement of parameter efficiency, requesting comparison in GPU-hours, memory, and latency; (2) inconsistency and potential under-optimization of baselines across tasks; (3) possibly exaggerated robustness claims (\"orders of magnitude\" gains in extreme settings); (4) limited task complexity (mainly reactive skills, lacking multi-stage/sequential reasoning); (5) scalability concerns for multi-task/continual learning with one encoder per task; and (6) missing comparison to other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, adapters). By contrast, the AI review's main concerns are: (1) missing/incomplete PPO and reward function details, harming reproducibility and attribution; (2) a discrepancy between training frames in Appendix B and steps in the convergence plot; (3) lack of statistical analysis and inter-rater reliability in the human study, and insufficient discussion of cases where PULSE is more human-like; (4) absence of real-world/hardware experiments; and (5) a desire for more precise parameter-count reporting. Only a very shallow commonality exists around the need for more rigorous or precise empirical claims (overstated parameter efficiency/robustness vs. missing hyperparameters/statistics), but the concrete issues and emphases differ substantially. Hence alignment on weaknesses is low.",
      "overall": "Taken together, both reviews clearly agree on what the paper is about, why it is interesting, and what its key positive contributions are: a parameter-efficient RL-trained task encoder that conditions a frozen BFM, preserves natural motion, improves task performance and robustness, and supports multi-modal control. On the critical side, however, they largely talk past each other: the human review is more conceptual and high-level (task complexity, multi-task scaling, PEFT comparisons, strength of claims), while the AI review is more concerned with reproducibility, training details, statistical rigor, and exact parameter counts. Because strengths are strongly aligned but weaknesses are not, the overall substantive alignment is moderate rather than high."

        "explanation": {
          "strength": "Both reviews agree on the core motivation: adapting a frozen behavior foundation model (MaskedMimic) to downstream humanoid control tasks via lightweight task-specific tokens/encoders trained with RL, preserving motion priors and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. They both highlight parameter efficiency (~200k params), strong empirical performance across several humanoid tasks, robustness to OOD perturbations, human-like motion validated via a user study, and flexibility for multi-modal prompting as key strengths. The human review adds emphasis on scalability across many tasks, while the AI review adds more detail on ablations and convergence curves, but these do not change the shared core picture.",
          "weakness": "There is partial overlap on weaknesses: both raise concerns around how robustness/OOD claims are supported (the human review suggests possible overstatement; the AI review points to narrow OOD evaluation) and around evaluation fairness/efficiency metrics (the human review asks for GPU-hours, memory, latency; the AI review for wall-clock times, equal parallelization, and broader convergence curves). However, the human review uniquely criticizes lack of comparison to alternative PEFT methods and limitations for multi-task/continual learning and task complexity, while the AI review instead focuses on missing methodological details, human-study design/statistics, lack of objective motion-quality metrics, and sim-only validation. Thus, overlapping concerns exist at a high level, but many concrete criticisms are distinct.",
          "overall": "In overall judgment, both reviews see the method as a novel, modular, and practically valuable way to adapt BFMs with strong empirical results and human-like control, while noting that some claims (robustness, efficiency/practicality) require more careful or broader evaluation. The alignment on core contributions and main positive takeaways is high, but the set of detailed weaknesses is only moderately overlapping, leading to a generally consistent but not identical emphasis on limitations."

          "strength": "Both reviews converge on the same core contributions: adapting a frozen behavior foundation model via a lightweight task encoder, strong parameter efficiency, robust performance across multiple humanoid tasks, preservation of human-like motion validated by a user study, and flexible multi-modal prompting. The AI review adds more detail on ablations and quantitative results, while the human review puts slightly more explicit emphasis on scalability to many tasks, but these differences are secondary.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on questioning the strength/precision of efficiency and robustness claims, including concern that the reported robustness gains (e.g., 'orders of magnitude') may be overstated and that efficiency claims need clearer quantification. However, the AI review introduces many additional, substantial critiques—missing methodological details, evaluation fairness issues, narrow OOD and human-study design, lack of motion-quality metrics, and sim-to-real gaps—while the human review uniquely stresses limited task complexity, poor scalability to multi-task/continual settings, and missing comparisons to other parameter-efficient tuning methods.",
          "overall": "Both reviews share a broadly positive judgment of the method as a novel, modular, and empirically strong, parameter-efficient adaptation approach, with non-fatal but important limitations in the experimental claims and scope. Their focus and conclusions are aligned on the main story, but the AI review surfaces a much wider set of methodological and evaluation concerns than the human review, leading to high alignment on strengths but only moderate alignment on weaknesses and thus a moderately high overall substantive match."
