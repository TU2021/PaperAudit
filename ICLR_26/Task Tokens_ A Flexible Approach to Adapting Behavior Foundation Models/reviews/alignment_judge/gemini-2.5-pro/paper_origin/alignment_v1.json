Review A focuses on overstated claims, limited task complexity, and missing PEFT comparisons, while Review B focuses on reproducibility issues (missing hyperparameters), inconsistent experimental reporting, and a lack of statistical rigor.",

This results in a moderate overall alignment, as they agree on why the paper is good but disagree on its primary flaws."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the exact same set of core strengths: the novel and modular design, high parameter efficiency, robustness to perturbations, human-like motion confirmed by a user study, and flexible multi-modal integration. The alignment is very high, with differences only in the level of detail.",
          "weakness": "There is low alignment on weaknesses, with only minor overlap on questioning efficiency claims and baseline fairness. Review A focuses on conceptual limits (task complexity, multi-task scalability, PEFT comparison), while Review B focuses on methodological rigor (reproducibility, human study bias, lack of objective metrics).",
          "overall": "The reviews show very high alignment on the paper's strengths but diverge significantly on its weaknesses, leading to a moderate overall match. While both conclude the idea is promising but flawed, they base their critiques on different substantive issues (conceptual scope vs. experimental rigor)."

The alignment is very high, with Review B simply providing more granular evidence for the same points.",
          "weakness": "There is moderate overlap, with both reviews flagging overstated claims about robustness and parameter efficiency, and a need for better reporting on compute time. However, they also raise distinct major concerns: Review A focuses on the lack of PEFT comparisons and multi-task scalability, while Review B provides a deep critique of reproducibility, human study design, and missing quantitative metrics.",
          "overall": "The reviews align very strongly on the paper's strengths but only moderately on its weaknesses, where they prioritize different types of critiques (conceptual gaps vs. reproducibility/rigor). This results in a high overall alignment, as both reach a similar conclusion of a promising but flawed paper, despite focusing on different flaws."
