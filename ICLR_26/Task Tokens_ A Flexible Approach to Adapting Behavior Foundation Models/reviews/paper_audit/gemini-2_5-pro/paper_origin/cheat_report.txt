Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several significant internal inconsistencies and reporting issues have been identified that affect the validity and trustworthiness of the presented results.

### Integrity and Consistency Risk Report

**1. Contradictory Numerical Results for the Main Method Across Tables**

The paper reports different performance values for what appears to be the identical experimental setup in different tables. This is a major inconsistency that undermines the reliability of the quantitative evaluation.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   The success rate for the main proposed method, `Task Tokens (ours) + J.C.`, on the **Steering** task is reported as **88.69 ± 4.04%** in **Table 1** (Block #22) and **Table 3** (Block #56).
    *   However, in the ablation study in **Table 4** (Block #57), the result for the same configuration (described as the main setup in Appendix B, Block #49: `Bigger MLP=True`, `Using Current Pose=True`) is **87.77 ± 7.14%**.
    *   Similarly, the success rate for `Task Tokens (ours)` (without joint conditioning) on the **Steering** task is reported as **83.66 ± 5.66%** in **Table 3** (Block #56), but as **78.59 ± 8.93%** in **Table 4** (Block #57).

*   **Impact:** These direct numerical contradictions for the same experimental condition raise serious questions about the accuracy and reproducibility of the reported results.

**2. Unverifiable Claims due to Inconsistent Figure and Legend**

The key claim regarding out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is supported by a figure with a critically flawed legend, making the results impossible to interpret.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Figure 4** (plots in Block #27, #28) is presented to demonstrate the method's robustness. In both the friction and gravity perturbation plots, a **red line** clearly indicates the best-performing method.
    *   However, the accompanying legend in the figure caption (**Block #25**) reads: "Task Tokens (ours) • Task Tokens (ours) + J.C. • PULSE • AMP • PureRL". There is no method associated with the color red. In other figures (e.g., Figure 3), "Task Tokens" is green, "PULSE" is blue, "AMP" is yellow, and "PureRL" is brown.
    *   The best-performing method shown in the plots is therefore unidentified, rendering the central claim of superior OOD generalization unverifiable from the provided manuscript.

*   **Impact:** A core contribution of the paper—robustness to OOD perturbations—is not substantiated by the evidence presented.

**3. Contradiction Between Claims of Motion Quality and Human Study Data**

The paper claims that the proposed method preserves natural, human-like motion quality, but the results of the human study show that a key baseline (PULSE) is consistently preferred.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   The abstract (Block #2) and introduction (Block #4) emphasize that the method preserves "diverse control characteristics" and generates "natural, human-like motions".
    *   The human study results in **Table 2** (Block #26) report the "win rate" of Task Tokens against other methods. Against the **PULSE** baseline, the win rates are consistently low across all tasks (14.80%, 46.44%, 36.28%, 24.19%, 39.13%).
    *   A win rate below 50% indicates that participants judged PULSE's motions to be more human-like than those from Task Tokens. The paper acknowledges this in a single sentence at the end of Section 4.3 (Block #29), but this finding directly contradicts the broader claims about motion quality that frame the paper's contributions.

*   **Impact:** The framing of the method's benefits is misleading. The data suggests a trade-off where the proposed method improves task success (Table 1) at the expense of motion realism when compared to the state-of-the-art PULSE baseline.

**4. Ambiguous and Inconsistent Reporting of the "Task Tokens (ours)" Method**

The results for the core method, "Task Tokens (ours)," are reported inconsistently, creating ambiguity about its exact configuration and performance.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   In the main results table (**Table 1**, Block #22), "Task Tokens (ours)" is a composite row representing the method with Joint Conditioning (J.C.) for three tasks and without it for two others.
    *   In the appendix (**Table 3**, Block #56), a row also labeled "Task Tokens (ours)" (without J.C.) reports different results for the same tasks. For example, for the **Reach** task, the success rate is **95.37 ± 1.80%**. This value does not appear in Table 1.
    *   This creates confusion as to what the baseline "Task Tokens (ours)" configuration is and why its performance differs between tables.

*   **Impact:** The lack of clear and consistent reporting for the main method makes it difficult to understand the precise contribution and performance of the proposed approach without J.C.

### Conclusion

The manuscript contains multiple high-impact, evidence-based problems, including direct numerical contradictions between tables, a critically flawed figure legend that makes a key result unverifiable, and a significant discrepancy between the claims of motion quality and the paper's own human study data. These issues materially affect the scientific validity and trustworthiness of the work and must be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication.
