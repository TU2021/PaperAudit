# Innovation & Motivation Report

## 1. The Authors' Claimed Contribution
- Core Problem: Few-shot medical anomaly detection that must distinguish among multiple anomaly categories (not just normal vs abnormal), potentially with co-occurring pathologies.
- Claimed Gap: “Recent advancements in few-shot medical AD have treated normal and abnormal cases as a one-class classification problem, often overlooking the distinction among multiple anomaly categories.” (Abstract) and “few-shot multi-anomaly detection for medical data remains underexplored.” (Related Work)
- Proposed Solution: SD-MAD, a two-stage, sign-driven framework on CLIP/MedCLIP:
  1) Training-time inter-anomaly alignment via Shift Adapters (parameter-efficient updates on selected transformer layers) and an anchor-based hinge-style loss that uses a “normal” prompt to bound positives/negatives (Eq. 4–5) and amplify separability among anomaly categories.
  2) Inference-time automatic sign selection (Eq. 6) that discards outlier prompts using a decision-region proximity criterion (Def. 3.2; Remark 3.3) to mitigate intra-anomaly uncertainty caused by few-shot data and prompt noise.
  The paper also proposes three evaluation protocols: normal vs abnormal AUROC, multi-label prediction (Hamming score, subset accuracy), and category-wise AUROC.

## 2. Comparative Scrutiny (The "Trial")
*Here, we analyze how the paper stands against the identified similar works.*

### vs. Towards Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FineGrainedAD)
- Identified Overlap: Both pursue few-shot anomaly detection via fine-grained vision–language alignment, injecting rich textual semantics and lightly adapting CLIP. They enforce stronger image–text alignment and use structured objectives to sharpen separability.
- Manuscript's Defense:
  - Scope differentiation: The manuscript asserts that “few-shot multi-anomaly detection for medical data remains underexplored.” (Related Work) and frames prior few-shot AD as predominantly one-class, lacking multi-category distinctions (Abstract).
  - Baseline positioning: In Section 4.3, it states “prior few-shot AD methods do not natively handle multi-category scenarios,” using CLIP/MedCLIP as baselines for multi-label/category-wise tasks.
  - Methodic distinction: Introduces a “normal” anchor in the loss (Eq. 4–5) to bound positives/negatives and an explicit inference-time sign selection rule (Eq. 6), tailored to category-wise medical anomalies with co-occurrence.
- Reviewer's Assessment: The domain shift (industrial datasets to medical multi-anomaly) is a valid distinction. However, methodologically, SD-MAD’s anchor-based margin and prompt selection are incremental variants of the fine-grained alignment theme. The paper would benefit from explicitly citing and contrasting with FineGrainedAD’s MFSC/MLLP/MLSA to substantiate novelty beyond domain specialization.

### vs. FADE: Few-shot/zero-shot Anomaly Detection Engine using Large Vision-Language Model
- Identified Overlap: Shared CLIP-based anomaly detection under few/zero-shot, prompt ensembles/curation to reduce prompt noise, and light CLIP adaptation for better patch-level alignment and pixel-level AUROC.
- Manuscript's Defense:
  - Scope differentiation: The manuscript emphasizes multi-anomaly, multi-label medical detection and introduces explicit category-wise AUROC protocols, noting that prior few-shot AD methods are one-class oriented (Abstract; Section 4.3).
  - Methodic distinction: SD-MAD adds an anchor-relative hinge loss (Eq. 4–5) and a formal sign selection criterion (Eq. 6), with three-tier evaluation including multi-label and category-wise recognition.
- Reviewer's Assessment: SD-MAD extends FADE’s paradigm to multi-anomaly medical recognition and formalizes prompt selection. The anchor-based margin is conceptually aligned with “normal” baselines common in AD/OOD. The novelty is primarily in application scope and modest algorithmic tweaks; the manuscript should cite FADE or analogous prompt-ensemble AD works to reinforce positioning.

### vs. Learning to Prompt for Vision-Language Models (CoOp)
- Identified Overlap: Parameter-efficient adaptation of CLIP via prompt-side mechanisms; class-specific text embeddings as discriminative prototypes; mitigating prompt brittleness.
- Manuscript's Defense:
  - Approach difference: SD-MAD opts for Shift Adapters in image/text encoders and an anchor-based contrastive objective rather than learning prompt contexts; it additionally introduces inference-time sign selection to discard outlier prompts (Eq. 6).
  - Gap framing: It claims medical few-shot multi-anomaly detection is underexplored (Related Work) and that existing few-shot AD is largely one-class (Abstract).
- Reviewer's Assessment: While SD-MAD’s parameter-efficient tuning and prompt curation resonate with CoOp’s ethos, the technical path (adapters + anchor loss + decision-region sign selection) differs from prompt-only learning. The novelty relative to CoOp is incremental—recombining known VLM adaptation motifs for a specific medical multi-anomaly setting. The manuscript should explicitly acknowledge prompt learning literature (e.g., CoOp) to avoid appearing siloed.

### vs. Local-Prompt: Extensible Local Prompts for Few-Shot OOD Detection
- Identified Overlap: Few-shot, prompt-driven OOD/anomaly detection; anchoring to a normal/global baseline; focusing on locally informative cues; selective prompt usage to mitigate uncertainty.
- Manuscript's Defense:
  - Clinical scope: Positions the need to distinguish specific medical anomaly categories (Introduction) and argues prior few-shot AD methods are not multi-category capable (Section 4.3).
  - Technique: SD-MAD’s “normal” anchor (Eq. 4–5) and inference sign selection (Eq. 6) formalize margins and prompt filtering under multi-label demands.
- Reviewer's Assessment: SD-MAD’s anchor and selection concepts parallel Local-Prompt’s coarse-to-fine/local prompt refinement, making the contribution feel incremental in method while novel in clinical multi-anomaly application. A more explicit comparison to local-prompt/OOD frameworks would clarify what is genuinely new versus adapted.

### vs. GalLoP: Learning Global and Local Prompts for Vision-Language Models
- Identified Overlap: Multi-prompt strategies, locality-aware alignment, robustness to OOD, parameter-efficient VLM adaptation; selective or sparse prompt usage.
- Manuscript's Defense:
  - Distinction: SD-MAD relies on radiological “sign” prompts aligned to anomaly categories, uses a normal anchor for margin enforcement, and performs automatic sign selection to suppress ambiguous prompts (Eq. 6), claiming multi-anomaly medical detection is underexplored (Related Work).
- Reviewer's Assessment: Methodologically consonant with GalLoP’s multi-prompt/locality ideas, SD-MAD contributes a medical instantiation with category-wise protocols and an explicit anchor-based hinge loss. The novelty lies in the clinical task setting and evaluation structuring; technical innovations are modest refinements of existing VLM prompt-adaptation paradigms.

### vs. Few-shot Adaptation of Medical Vision-Language Models (Shakeri et al.)
- Identified Overlap: Few-shot adaptation of medical VLMs, adapter-based strategies, text-informed calibration, structured benchmarking across medical modalities.
- Manuscript's Defense:
  - Task specialization: SD-MAD targets multi-anomaly detection with multi-label/category-wise outputs, claiming such a few-shot scenario is underexplored in medical imaging (Related Work).
  - Methodic elements: Shift Adapters and anchor-based loss (Eq. 4–5) plus inference sign selection (Eq. 6) are used to shape inter-/intra-anomaly separability.
- Reviewer's Assessment: Within the medical VLM space, SD-MAD’s focus on multi-anomaly detection and its protocols are a meaningful application pivot. Algorithmic components (adapters, cosine-based alignment, class-wise calibration) are consistent with surveyed strategies; the manuscript should directly situate itself against such medical few-shot VLM benchmarks to strengthen the motivation claim.

## 3. Novelty Verdict
- Innovation Type: Incremental
- Assessment:
  The manuscript articulates a clinically relevant gap—few-shot medical anomaly detection beyond one-class normal/abnormal, with multiple co-occurring categories—and proposes a coherent CLIP-based solution with an anchor-relative hinge loss and inference-time prompt selection. Against the similar works, its technical novelty is modest: it recombines well-established VLM adaptation techniques (adapters, margin-based alignment, prompt ensembles/selection) into a medical multi-anomaly framework and adds well-defined evaluation protocols. The manuscript’s motivation is defensible on task scope (medical multi-anomaly, multi-label/category-wise) but weakened by limited engagement with closely related prompt-learning and few-shot AD literature outside the medical domain.
  - Strength:
    - Clear, clinically grounded motivation and explicit recognition of multi-category, multi-label demands.
    - Formalization of anchor-relative inter-anomaly loss (Eq. 4–5) and an explicit decision-region-based sign selection rule (Eq. 6).
    - Structured, three-layer evaluation across seven datasets, showing consistent improvements on relevant metrics and scenarios.
  - Weakness:
    - Technical contributions closely mirror existing VLM prompt/adaptation paradigms (fine-grained alignment, margin enforcement, prompt curation), making novelty incremental.
    - Insufficient citation and direct comparison to key similar works (FineGrainedAD, FADE, CoOp, Local-Prompt, GalLoP), leaving the defense against overlap underdeveloped.
    - Missing specifics (e.g., the LLM used for sign generation; δ in Eq. 6; seeds/run variability), and acknowledged prompt–category ambiguity undermines robustness claims.
