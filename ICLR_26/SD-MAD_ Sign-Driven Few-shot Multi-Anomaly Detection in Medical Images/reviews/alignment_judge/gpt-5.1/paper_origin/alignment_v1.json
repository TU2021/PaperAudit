    "explanation": {
      "strength": "Both reviews agree on the central motivation: few-shot multi-anomaly detection in medical imaging, going beyond one-class anomaly detection. They both highlight the key idea of leveraging radiological sign descriptions / anomaly-specific textual prompts with a CLIP/MedCLIP-style VLM, and they concur that the method is practically relevant for real-world clinical multi-anomaly scenarios. Both note strong empirical improvements over CLIP/MedCLIP on medical datasets and emphasize the introduction of multi-anomaly evaluation metrics/protocols as a contribution. Review B gives more architectural detail (Shift Adapter, anchor loss, sign selection), but this is consistent with and not contradictory to Review A’s high-level description. Hence alignment on motivation, contributions, and core strengths is high though not perfect, since Review B additionally stresses adapter-based fine-tuning and anchor-loss design which Review A does not mention explicitly.",
      "weakness": "The overlap on weaknesses is modest. The main commonality is concern about the dependence on high-quality textual sign descriptions: Review A worries about noise/misalignment in medical descriptions; Review B repeatedly criticizes the lack of detail and validation in the sign generation pipeline and the risk of noisy/overlapping prompts. Beyond that, the foci diverge. Review A emphasizes: (1) limited baselines (only CLIP/MedCLIP, missing other anomaly-detection baselines like AnomalyCLIP), (2) lack of open-set / unseen anomaly handling, (3) missing statistical measures in few-shot experiments, (4) incomplete analysis of anomaly co-occurrence patterns in datasets, and (5) absence of pixel-level AUROC in the main text. Review B instead focuses on: (1) underspecified and arguably non-implementable sign-selection mechanism (D_inf, δ, decision regions), (2) missing details on pixel-level integration with MVFA and general reproducibility (hyperparameters, thresholds), (3) narrow experimental scope (single multi-anomaly modality, 1-shot only, no shot-scaling or cross-organ tests), and (4) unexplained surprising metrics (near-zero subset accuracy, perfect AUROC cases). These are largely orthogonal criticisms rather than the same issues phrased differently, so weakness/error alignment is only moderate to low.",
      "overall": "In aggregate, both reviews are broadly positive about the paper’s idea and empirical promise and view the work as a practically useful, moderately novel extension of CLIP-style VLMs to few-shot multi-anomaly medical detection using radiological sign prompts. They concur that multi-label/multi-anomaly framing and appropriate evaluation metrics are important and underexplored, and that SD-MAD delivers improvements over CLIP/MedCLIP. However, they diverge significantly on what they see as the main technical and experimental shortcomings: Review A concentrates on breadth and realism of evaluation (baselines, open-set behavior, statistical rigor, dataset co-occurrence, presentation of pixel-level metrics), while Review B concentrates on missing algorithmic and implementation details (sign selection, sign generation pipeline, MVFA integration, thresholds/hyperparameters) and experimental depth (shot scaling, cross-organ validation, analysis of odd results). Because they agree strongly on the high-level contribution and strengths but have only partial overlap on weaknesses, the overall substantive alignment is moderate."

          "strength": "Both reviews agree that the core motivation is few-shot multi-anomaly detection in medical images, moving beyond one-class AD by leveraging radiological sign descriptions with VLMs, and both emphasize that SD-MAD is novel and clinically relevant. They also align on strong empirical performance across multiple datasets and on the value of the newly proposed multi-anomaly evaluation metrics. Review B adds much more detail on specific technical components (anchor-based loss, shift adapters, sign selection), but this elaboration is consistent with Review A’s high-level strengths rather than divergent.",
          "weakness": "Both note limited/weak baselines in the multi-anomaly setting, and both emphasize the heavy dependence on textual sign descriptions / prompts as an important limitation. They also converge on concerns about missing statistical rigor in the few-shot experiments and insufficient dataset/protocol transparency (e.g., co-occurrence stats, splits). Review B introduces additional technical-implementation critiques (e.g., unclear sign selection algorithm, anchor loss specifics, MVFA integration details) that do not appear in Review A, while Review A uniquely mentions open-set/novel anomaly handling and pixel-level metrics placement.",
          "overall": "Substantively, the two reviews converge on the same main story: a well-motivated, novel multi-anomaly few-shot framework with strong empirical results but underdeveloped baselines, heavy reliance on prompts, and missing experimental/implementation detail. The AI review is more granular and technical, and introduces extra weaknesses not discussed by the human, yet its overall assessment and priorities are largely consistent with Review A, leading to high but not perfect alignment."
