          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core contribution as using radiological sign descriptions for few-shot multi-anomaly detection and praise the introduction of new, relevant evaluation metrics. Review B adds more technical detail on the specific mechanisms (anchor loss, adapters), but the high-level agreement on the paper's strengths is very strong.",
          "weakness": "There is overlap on concerns about the quality/generation of textual prompts and the lack of statistical tests, but they diverge on the most critical points. Review B identifies a major technical flaw that the core sign-selection method is not executable as described, a point entirely missed by Review A, which instead focuses on limited baselines and the lack of open-set discussion.",
          "overall": "The reviews align very well on the paper's strengths but diverge significantly on its primary weaknesses, leading to a moderate overall match. While both are cautiously positive, Review A's critique focuses on experimental scope and context, whereas Review B's is a more fundamental critique of the method's technical clarity and reproducibility."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the core strengths as the novel formulation of multi-anomaly detection and the use of radiological sign descriptions, supported by strong empirical results. Review B provides a more granular breakdown of the technical components (anchor loss, adapters), but the main points and emphasis are highly aligned with Review A.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the same primary weaknesses: limited baseline comparisons, lack of statistical rigor (e.g., no standard deviations), and insufficient details regarding the text prompts and datasets. Review A also raises the conceptual issue of open-set detection, while Review B focuses more on the lack of algorithmic clarity, but the core experimental critiques overlap strongly.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment in substance, both recognizing the paper's valuable contribution while pointing out significant flaws in experimental validation and reporting. Their overall judgment is consistent—a promising but flawed paper—with differences primarily in the specific secondary critiques they choose to emphasize."

Review B provides a more granular breakdown of the technical strengths (e.g., anchor loss, adapters), but these are encompassed by Review A's broader points.",
          "weakness": "There is strong alignment on several key weaknesses, including the limited baselines, lack of statistical rigor, issues with text prompts, and insufficient dataset details. However, Review B adds a deep technical critique of the method's algorithmic clarity that is absent from Review A, while Review A uniquely points out the limitation regarding open-set detection.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment in their overall assessment, agreeing that the paper presents a novel and promising approach but suffers from significant reporting and experimental flaws. The main divergence is in the depth of the critique, with Review B providing a much more detailed technical deconstruction of the method's core components, while Review A's critique is slightly broader."
