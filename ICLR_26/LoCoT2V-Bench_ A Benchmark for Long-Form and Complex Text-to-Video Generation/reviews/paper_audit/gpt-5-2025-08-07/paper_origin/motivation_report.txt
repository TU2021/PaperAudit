# Innovation & Motivation Report

## 1. The Authors' Claimed Contribution
- Core Problem: Evaluating long-form text-to-video generation under complex prompts where current benchmarks, tailored to short clips and low-level metrics, fail to capture event-level adherence, long-range temporal coherence, and higher-level narrative/thematic qualities.
- Claimed Gap: “Existing benchmarks mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative coherence and thematic expression.” (Abstract) In Related Work, they further state that recent benchmarks “typically [are] for short, simpler prompts,” and that long-form efforts “either use simplified prompts or have limited prompt counts/complexity.”
- Proposed Solution: LoCoT2V-Bench, a 240-video benchmark (30–60 s) with long, complex prompts (avg 236.66 words; complexity avg 8.75) and a five-dimension evaluation suite: static quality, text–video alignment (overall and event-level), temporal quality (including inter-/intra-event consistency and transition smoothness), content clarity, and “Human Expectation Realization Degree” (HERD) covering narrative flow, emotional response, character development, etc. Built primarily on automated tools/MLLMs, validated across nine long-video generation systems.

## 2. Comparative Scrutiny (The "Trial")
Here, we analyze how the paper stands against the identified similar works.

### vs. LoCoT2V-Bench: A Benchmark for Long-Form and Complex Text-to-Video Generation (Zheng et al.)
- Identified Overlap: Title, abstract, scope, and methodology appear identical to the manuscript.
- Manuscript's Defense: The provided manuscript summary does not acknowledge a prior version or differentiate from this entry. No explicit citation or statement of incremental changes relative to an earlier version is present in the supplied text. The appendix provides a repository link (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LoCoT2V-Bench-1518/) but does not position the work against a preprint with the same title/abstract.
- Reviewer's Assessment: If this similar work is a preprint or prior public version by the same authors, the manuscript needs to explicitly articulate what is new (e.g., expanded dataset, revised metrics, stronger validation) and cite the prior version. As-is, this represents a serious novelty ambiguity. If it is indeed the same artifact duplicated in the “Similar Works,” motivation per se is sound, but the originality claim is not assessable without clarification.

### vs. VideoRepair: Improving Text-to-Video Generation via Misalignment Evaluation and Localized Refinement
- Identified Overlap: Both leverage MLLMs/VLMs to detect fine-grained text–video misalignment via structured questions and granular correspondences; both focus on complex prompts with multiple objects/attributes and localized reasoning.
- Manuscript's Defense: The manuscript does not cite VideoRepair. It differentiates itself implicitly by proposing a benchmark and multi-dimensional evaluation suite (including event-level alignment with order-aware matching and HERD), rather than a repair algorithm. Related Work positions their contribution as filling gaps in long-form evaluation, stating that “recent benchmarks…typically [are] for short, simpler prompts” and that long-form efforts have “limited prompt counts/complexity,” but does not engage with misalignment-repair pipelines.
- Reviewer's Assessment: The scope is meaningfully different (benchmark vs. refinement framework). The overlap in MLLM-driven diagnostic philosophy is real but not disqualifying; however, the omission of this closely aligned evaluation/diagnostics line weakens the manuscript’s positioning. A brief discussion contrasting event-level alignment/QA scoring with VideoRepair’s QA-based planning/repair would strengthen the defense.

### vs. Exploring AIGC Video Quality: Visual Harmony, Video–Text Consistency and Domain Distribution Gap (TriVQA)
- Identified Overlap: Multi-dimensional assessment of AIGC videos emphasizing (i) visual quality/harmony, (ii) video–text consistency, and (iii) cross-model/domain variations—an evaluation framing close to the manuscript’s Static Quality, Text–Video Alignment, and model/theme analyses.
- Manuscript's Defense: Not cited. The manuscript claims novelty in long-form, complex prompts and higher-level/narrative metrics: “multi-dimensional evaluation with higher-level dimensions (e.g., thematic expression) and event-level adherence.” Related Work distinguishes from prior benchmarks by prompt length/complexity and by event/narrative metrics, supported by Table 1 (LoCoT2V: 240 samples, 236.66 words, complexity 8.75 vs. others’ shorter/less complex prompts or smaller counts).
- Reviewer's Assessment: The benchmark’s focus on long videos with structured events and HERD provides a substantive scope extension beyond TriVQA’s general AIGC QA framing. Nonetheless, TriVQA’s conceptual proximity (visual harmony and consistency dimensions) should be acknowledged. The manuscript’s differentiation—event-structured alignment and explicit narrative-level evaluation at longer durations—appears significant and valid.

### vs. Text-to-Audio Generation Synchronized with Videos (T2AV-Bench)
- Identified Overlap: Benchmarking for alignment and temporal consistency under real-world conditions, using automated pipelines to measure cross-modal adherence and time coherence. Methodologically, both deploy embedding-based similarity and motion-aware measures.
- Manuscript's Defense: Not cited. The manuscript distinguishes itself by domain (text-to-video generation) and by the addition of event-level alignment and human-centric narrative/thematic metrics (HERD), specifically for long-form, multi-scene videos.
- Reviewer's Assessment: The cross-modal benchmarking paradigm is shared, but the target modality and evaluation axes (event/narrative-level for long-form T2V) are different. The manuscript’s extension to structured, order-aware event matching and high-level human expectation scoring justifies its distinct motivation. Acknowledging T2AV-Bench as inspiration for alignment/temporal-consistency benchmarking would improve completeness.

### vs. ModelScopeT2V and FusionFrames (generation methods)
- Identified Overlap: The manuscript evaluates the very properties these systems aim to improve (motion smoothness, temporal stability, text-conditioning fidelity), and shows where low-level success may not entail narrative/event-level success.
- Manuscript's Defense: The paper positions itself as an evaluator, not a generator. It cites various generation baselines and evaluates nine representatives. It argues that existing evaluations are insufficient for long-form narratives: “Existing evaluations emphasize short videos and low-level metrics and often rely on simplified prompts.” (Introduction)
- Reviewer's Assessment: Distinct scope (benchmark vs. methods). The manuscript appropriately motivates the need to go beyond metrics like FVD/CLIPSIM by adding event-level and narrative/thematic measures, which is a valid and valuable extension.

## 3. Novelty Verdict
- Innovation Type: Application-Oriented, with incremental metric engineering
- Assessment:
  The core motivation—to provide a long-form, complex-prompt T2V benchmark with structured event-level alignment, granular temporal coherence, and high-level narrative/thematic evaluation—is well articulated and supported with concrete evidence (prompt complexity/length, multi-scene focus, HERD). The manuscript convincingly shows that prior benchmarks either use simpler/shorter prompts or have limited counts at comparable complexity, and lack combined event-level alignment plus explicit narrative/thematic scoring for 30–60 s outputs. The correlation analyses substantiate the claim that low-level visual quality does not guarantee semantic/narrative adherence.
  
  However, two concerns remain:
  - The Similar Works include an entry with the identical title and abstract. Without an explicit differentiation, novelty relative to that artifact is unclear.
  - The manuscript overlooks closely related evaluation paradigms (e.g., TriVQA, T2AV-Bench, misalignment QA frameworks like VideoRepair). While the scope difference is real and the authors’ framing holds, acknowledging and contrasting these would bolster the motivation and positioning.

  - Strength:
    - Clear and evidenced gap: “short, low-level” evaluations vs. long-form, event/narrative-level needs; Table 1 demonstrates superior prompt length/complexity at moderate scale (240 samples).
    - Technically coherent suite covering event-structured alignment (with order penalties), inter-/intra-event temporal consistency, and human-centric HERD; empirical findings (e.g., low narrative flow across models) validate the necessity of these dimensions.
    - Analysis showing weak correlations between static quality and alignment/HERD strengthens the argument for multi-dimensional, higher-level metrics.
  - Weakness:
    - Potential duplication (identical “LoCoT2V-Bench” in Similar Works) not addressed; novelty vs. preprint/version unclear.
    - Heavy reliance on MLLMs/VLMs with some unspecified parameters (e.g., R in content clarity; some weights in appendices); possible evaluator drift/bias is acknowledged but not deeply validated.
    - Missing citations to adjacent evaluation efforts (TriVQA, T2AV-Bench, VideoRepair) that share alignment/temporal-consistency paradigms, reducing the thoroughness of the motivational contrast.

## 4. Key Evidence Anchors
- Abstract: “Existing benchmarks mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative coherence and thematic expression.”
- Introduction: “Existing evaluations emphasize short videos and low-level metrics and often rely on simplified prompts.”
- Related Work: “Recent benchmarks (VBench, EvalCrafter, VMBench, etc.)… typically for short, simpler prompts. Efforts for long-form evaluation (VBench-Long; VBench 2.0 complex plot/landscape) either use simplified prompts or have limited prompt counts/complexity.”
- Prompt Complexity Table (Related Work): “LoCoT2V-Bench (ours): 240; 236.66; 8.75 (9.01, 8.98, 8.25),” contrasted with VBench 2.0 (Complex Plot: 60; 117.15; 8.02; Complex Landscape: 30; 142.10; 8.34) and VBench-Long (946; 7.64; 2.54).
- Evaluation Design (Method): Event-level Alignment via DeepSeek-V3.1 event extraction, Hungarian matching, field-level similarity and order penalties; Temporal Quality including Transition Smoothness (PySceneDetect + RAFT + SSIM + feature similarities), inter-/intra-event SC/BC (Time-R1-7B, Grounded-SAM-2); HERD as polarity-aware binary VQA over seven human-centric dimensions.
- Empirical Findings (Experiments; Section 4.1, 4.3): Consistently low “Narrative Flow” across models; event-level alignment markedly lower than overall alignment; low correlations of static quality with alignment (Pearson r = 0.0841) and HERD (0.2136), motivating multi-dimensional, high-level assessment.
