Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several significant internal inconsistencies and methodological discrepancies have been identified. These issues materially affect the paper's scientific validity and trustworthiness.

### Integrity and Consistency Risk Report

**1. Inconsistent Naming and Reporting of Evaluation Metrics**

There are major discrepancies between the evaluation metrics as defined in the Method section, reported in the main results tables, and visualized in the Appendix.

*   **Evidence (Content Clarity):**
    *   **Method (Section 3.2.4, Block 24) and Results (Table 2, Block 25):** The sub-dimensions of Content Clarity are explicitly defined and reported as: "Theme Clarity (TC)", "**Logical Structure (LS)**", "**Information Completeness (ICP)**", and "Information Consistency (ICS)".
    *   **Visualization (Figure 7, Block 71, 74):** The corresponding radar plot in the appendix labels these axes as: "Theme Clarity", "**Object Structure**", "**Information Coherence**", and "Information Consistency".
    *   **Inconsistency:** "Logical Structure" is replaced with "Object Structure", and "Information Completeness" is replaced with "Information Coherence". These are not interchangeable terms and represent fundamentally different aspects of content evaluation.

*   **Evidence (HERD Metric):**
    *   **Method (Section 3.1, Block 16; Appendix B.8, Block 67) and Results (Table 4, Block 29):** The sub-dimensions of the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) are listed as: "Emotional Response", "Narrative Flow", "Character Development", "Visual Style", "Themes", "**Interpretive Depth**", and "Overall Impression".
    *   **Visualization (Figure 7, Block 71, 74):** The HERD radar plot labels the corresponding axis as "**Interaction Depth**".
    *   **Inconsistency:** "Interpretive Depth" and "Interaction Depth" are distinct concepts. This mismatch calls into question what was actually measured and visualized.

**2. Incomplete Visualization of Reported Results**

The visualizations provided in the appendix do not fully represent the data reported in the main results tables, which may mislead the reader about the scope of the evaluation.

*   **Evidence (Temporal Quality):**
    *   **Results (Table 3, Block 28):** The performance on Temporal Quality is broken down into **11** sub-dimensions, including "**WarpingError**" and "**HumanAction**".
    *   **Visualization (Figure 7, Block 71, 74):** The Temporal Quality radar plot only has **7** axes. The metrics "WarpingError" and "HumanAction" are entirely omitted from the visualization without any explanation.
    *   **Inconsistency:** The visualization selectively presents the results, failing to provide a complete graphical summary of the data reported in Table 3.

**3. Use of Undefined and Inconsistent Metrics in Case Study**

The case study presented in Appendix E introduces metrics that are not defined or mentioned anywhere else in the manuscript, and the metrics used are themselves inconsistent across different examples.

*   **Evidence (Undefined Metric "HPSV2"):**
    *   **Case Study (Figure 10, Block 127, 133; Figure 11, Block 130, 134):** The evaluation results for samples "food_3" and "minivlog_9" include a metric named "**HPSV2**" (e.g., "HPSV2: 0.5714").
    *   **Inconsistency:** This "HPSV2" metric is never defined in the Method section, nor is it included in any of the main results tables (Tables 2, 3, 4). Its origin and meaning are entirely absent from the paper.

*   **Evidence (Inconsistent Metric Reporting):**
    *   **Case Study (Figure 12, Block 137, 141):** In the next case study for sample "PETS_8", the "HPSV2" metric is replaced with "**Aesthetic**" (e.g., "Aesthetic: 0.6425").
    *   **Inconsistency:** It is unclear if "Aesthetic" is the same as "HPSV2" or if it corresponds to the "Aesthetic Quality (AQ)" metric from Table 2. The reported values do not align with the main results in Table 2 (e.g., for SkyReels-V2, Table 2 reports AQ=67.20, while Figure 12 reports Aesthetic=0.5000).

**4. Factual Contradictions in Appendix Content**

The appendix contains direct factual contradictions and clear copy-editing errors that undermine the paper's credibility.

*   **Evidence (Contradictory Prompt Description):**
    *   **Appendix E (Block 126):** The text description for the "food_3" prompt lists ingredients as "...chopped onions, followed by a mix of vegetables including green beans, and finally corn and sausages."
    *   **Appendix E (Figure 10, Block 133):** The prompt content displayed in the figure for the same sample lists different ingredients: "...adds lemons and potatoes together in one step, followed by onions, crabs, mushrooms, and green beans, and finally corn and sausages."
    *   **Inconsistency:** The list of ingredients is different, indicating a severe lack of attention to detail and raising questions about which prompt was actually used for generation and evaluation.

*   **Evidence (Incorrect Section Headings):**
    *   **Appendix C.5 (Block 109):** The section is titled "**HERD Evaluation Prompt**" but the content clearly describes the prompt for the four dimensions of **Content Clarity**.
    *   **Inconsistency:** This copy-paste error further demonstrates a lack of careful preparation of the manuscript.

### Conclusion

The manuscript suffers from multiple, high-impact internal inconsistencies. The discrepancies in metric naming, the incomplete visualizations, the use of undefined metrics, and the factual contradictions in the appendix are not minor issues. They fundamentally compromise the clarity, reproducibility, and trustworthiness of the presented research. These problems must be thoroughly addressed before the paper can be considered for publication.
