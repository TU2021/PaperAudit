          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core contributions: a novel benchmark for long, complex T2V generation that addresses a key gap. They highlight identical strengths, including the complex prompts, the comprehensive evaluation framework with novel metrics like HERD and event-level alignment, and the insightful experimental findings.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on three major weaknesses: the small benchmark size, the heavy reliance on LLMs for evaluation, and the lack of human validation. However, Review A uniquely criticizes the limited scope of models evaluated, while Review B introduces several distinct concerns about reproducibility, missing hyperparameters, and unclear metric aggregation.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's core strengths and overall positive-but-critical judgment. However, their focus diverges in the weakness section, with Review A concerned about evaluation scope and Review B focused on methodological rigor and reproducibility, leading to only a moderate match on the specific critiques."

Review B provides more granular detail on specific technical novelties, but the main points are perfectly aligned.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the limited dataset scale and the heavy, unvalidated reliance on MLLMs for evaluation as major weaknesses. However, Review B introduces a significant set of additional critiques regarding reproducibility (missing hyperparameters, incomplete code release) that are absent from Review A.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high overall alignment, agreeing on the paper's core contribution and its most significant strengths and validity-related weaknesses. The main divergence is Review B's additional, strong focus on reproducibility issues, which makes its critique broader than Review A's, though their final judgments are consistent."
