Summary
The paper proposes SPECTRA, a spectral target-aware graph augmentation framework to address imbalanced molecular property regression. It reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES (3.1), aligns pairs via GW/FGW (3.2), interpolates Laplacian eigenpairs and node features in a shared basis (3.3), reconstructs edges (3.4), applies a rarity-aware augmentation budget via KDE over labels (3.5), validates molecules by round-tripping to SMILES with RDKit (3.6), and trains a spectral GNN with edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions (3.7). Experiments on ESOL, FreeSolv, and Lipo evaluate generation quality (validity/uniqueness/novelty and property trends), predictive performance vs. baselines (MAE and SERA), error across target ranges, and efficiency Pareto fronts (4.1–4.4). Ablations test augmentation, alignment, and KDE prior effects (A.2).

Soundness
The core idea—geometry-aware alignment plus spectral interpolation—is plausible and grounded in spectral graph theory. Using FGW to obtain node correspondences (3.2) and Procrustes/QR for basis stabilization (3.3) addresses common instabilities. Interpolating eigenvalues maintains nonnegativity, so Lα remains PSD. However, there are several methodological concerns:
- Laplacian-to-adjacency reconstruction (3.4) via Wα = max(0, -Lα + diag(Lα)) does not guarantee Laplacian structure (row sums zero) nor chemical constraints; subsequent RDKit sanitation (3.6) may correct errors but leaves augmentation dependent on a post-hoc fixer rather than principled constraints.
- Multi-attribute edge channels (bond type, stereo, conjugation; 3.1) are treated as weighted adjacencies, then “stacked” if any positive weight (3.4). This lacks a clear discretization/thresholding scheme for categorical bond options and could yield ambiguous multi-channel positives per edge.
- Node feature interpolation is described as in “original node space” (3.3), contradicting earlier claims that features are interpolated in a shared spectral basis (Abstract; Fig. 2 caption), suggesting either an implementation mismatch or unclear exposition.
- The rarity-aware pairing strictly sorts neighbors by |yi − yj| (3.5), possibly encouraging label smoothing but not necessarily structural similarity; FGW mitigates this, but the pairing choice may create unrealistic intermediates if label proximity does not reflect feasible chemical interpolation.
- Evaluation fairness: baselines appear trained without augmented data while SPECTRA includes augmentation plus a specific spectral GNN (4.2). It is not stated whether baselines benefit from the same augmented samples or a comparable training size.
- Statistical rigor: number of runs/splits is unclear; “variance” is reported (Table 4) without specifying seeds or split protocol (A.3 only lists ranges; no splits). Some claims (100% validity in Table 1) seem unusually strong across all datasets and should be scrutinized.

Presentation
The paper is generally clear and well structured, with a logical pipeline and figures illustrating distribution and coverage. Nevertheless:
- Inconsistent nomenclature: “Chemb” in Table 4 likely refers to ChebNet (4.2; Table 4).
- Symbol reuse: α is used both in the FGW objective (3.2) and spectral mixing (3.3), potentially confusing.
- The text states “projected into the aligned eigenbasis” (Fig. 2 caption), yet 3.3 performs interpolation in node space, creating a confusing mismatch.
- Some figure/table references are inconsistent: “Table 3: t-SNE visualization…” (4.1; Block #28) while t-SNE plots are figures (30–32).
- Experimental details such as split protocol, number of runs, and augmentation percentages (perc in 3.5) are not fully specified; runtime accounting in the Pareto plot (4.4; Fig. 5) does not clarify whether augmentation time is included.

Contribution
The work addresses a relatively underexplored setting: imbalanced molecular regression with a geometry-aware, spectral-domain augmentation. It combines FGW alignment with spectral interpolation, label-density–aware budgeting, and an edge-aware spectral GNN. The novelty lies in using spectral synthesis to create structurally coherent intermediates specifically targeting sparse label regions, and evaluating both generation plausibility and performance in low-density ranges. While related spectral augmentation exists for contrastive learning (2.2), and imbalanced regression techniques exist (2.1), this integrated approach for molecular regression is a meaningful contribution.

Strengths
- Coherent pipeline combining FGW alignment, spectral interpolation, and RDKit validation (3.2–3.6).
- Clear focus on imbalanced regression, with density-aware budgeting (3.5) and SERA metric (4.2, Table 4).
- Empirical results show competitive MAE and improved performance in rare regions (4.2, 4.3; Fig. 4), and favorable efficiency trade-offs (4.4; Fig. 5).
- Ablation suggests benefit from alignment and KDE prior (A.2; Table 6).
- Interpretability angle via round-trip to SMILES and property trend analysis (4.1; Fig. 3 and associated discussion).

Weaknesses
- Chemical validity relies heavily on RDKit sanitation (3.6); edge channel discretization is under-specified (3.4), and 100% validity across datasets (Table 1) seems optimistic without failure case counts or thresholds.
- Inconsistency between abstract/figure claims and method details for node feature interpolation (Abstract; Fig. 2 vs. 3.3).
- Fairness of baseline comparisons unclear; augmentation seems unique to SPECTRA (4.2), and baseline training regimes (including augmentation or not) are not stated.
- Experimental rigor: lack of split/seeds details; “variance” usage without clarification (Table 4; A.3).
- Symbol reuse and naming inconsistencies (α in 3.2 vs. 3.3; “Chemb” in Table 4; “Table 3” t-SNE mislabel).
- No analysis of sensitivity to α (both FGW and spectral mixing) or reconstruction thresholds; no chemical constraint guarantees during synthesis beyond post-hoc sanitation.

Questions
- Can you clarify whether node features are interpolated in the spectral basis or original node space? Abstract and Fig. 2 claim spectral-basis interpolation, but 3.3 states original node space. Which is implemented?
- How are edge channel weights discretized to categorical bonds/stereochemistry/conjugation during reconstruction (3.4)? What thresholds are used, and how do you avoid multi-channel conflicts per edge?
- What is the split protocol (random seeds, folds, train/val/test proportions) and number of runs for MAE/SERA (Table 4)? Are reported “variances” across seeds or folds?
- Do baselines train with the same augmented samples or only original data? If only originals, can you provide baselines with augmentation to ensure fairness?
- Is augmentation time included in the runtime plotted in Fig. 5 (4.4)? If not, please provide end-to-end time including augmentation.
- How sensitive are results to α in FGW (3.2) and spectral mixing (3.3), to KDE bandwidth (Scott’s rule in Fig. 1 vs. 3.5), and to perc (3.5)? Please add a sensitivity analysis.
- Given 100% validity (Table 1), how many generated molecules were attempted per dataset, and what are the sanitation modes (strict vs. relaxed) proportions? Any failure cases?
- In GW/FGW with zero padding (3.2), how do you handle mappings to padded nodes when |VA| ≠ |VB|? Are unmatched nodes dropped or interpolated?

Rating
- Overall (10): 7 — Innovative spectral augmentation for imbalanced molecular regression with solid empirical signals, but methodological ambiguities and evaluation details need tightening (3.3, 3.4, 4.2; Table 4; Table 1).
- Novelty (10): 8 — Geometry-aware spectral synthesis targeted at rare regression regimes is distinctive relative to prior spectral and imbalance work (2.1, 2.2, 2.5).
- Technical Quality (10): 7 — The pipeline is plausible but reconstruction/discretization and basis interpolation inconsistencies, plus limited sensitivity/fairness analysis, weaken rigor (3.3–3.6; 4.2; A.2).
- Clarity (10): 7 — Generally clear with helpful figures, but symbol reuse, naming, and reference inconsistencies reduce clarity (3.2–3.3; 4.1–4.2; Table 4; Block #28).
- Confidence (5): 4 — Reasonable confidence based on detailed reading and cross-checking of sections and tables, though some implementation details are unspecified (3.3, 3.4, 4.2).


Summary
The authors present SPECTRA, a framework for spectral-domain augmentation aimed at improving performance on rare target ranges in molecular property regression. It builds multichannel Laplacians from SMILES (3.1), aligns graphs via GW/FGW (3.2), interpolates spectra and features to synthesize intermediates (3.3–3.4), budgets augmentation by KDE rarity (3.5), validates molecules by round-trip to SMILES (3.6), and trains an edge-aware Chebyshev spectral GNN (3.7). Experiments over ESOL, FreeSolv, and Lipo evaluate molecule validity/novelty, predictive metrics (MAE, SERA), error by target bins, and runtime vs. accuracy (4.1–4.4), with ablations on alignment and KDE (A.2).

Soundness
The spectral alignment and interpolation approach is grounded in theory, and the use of FGW is appropriate for handling structural and feature alignment. The rarity-aware budget addresses imbalance. However, several soundness issues emerge upon cross-checking:
- Laplacian reconstruction to adjacency (3.4) via clipping can yield arbitrary positive weights without guaranteeing chemically valid discretization across channels; reliance on RDKit sanitation (3.6) shifts correctness to a post-processing step.
- The claim of interpolating node features in a shared spectral basis (Abstract; Fig. 2) conflicts with 3.3’s interpolation in original node space; this discrepancy undermines the stated stability advantages.
- Pair selection by label proximity (3.5) might generate structurally implausible intermediates if label closeness does not correlate with cheminformatic feasibility; FGW alignment helps, but there is no constraint that ensures chemically reasonable paths in spectral space.
- The evaluation setup lacks details on data splits/seeds and whether baselines use augmentation (4.2); without these, it’s hard to assess fairness and statistical significance.

Presentation
The manuscript is readable and generally well organized, with a clear pipeline figure and multiple visual analyses. Issues noted:
- “Chemb” likely a typo for ChebNet in Table 4 (4.2).
- α is overloaded (FGW objective weight in 3.2 and spectral mixing coefficient in 3.3), creating potential confusion.
- The t-SNE visualization is referred to as “Table 3” in text (4.1; Block #28) but presented as figures (30–32); figure labeling is inconsistent.
- Experimental setup (A.3) lacks explicit split strategy, number of runs, and whether augmentation time is included in runtime plots (4.4; Fig. 5).

Contribution
Target-aware spectral augmentation in molecular regression is a timely and useful contribution. The integration of GW/FGW alignment, spectral interpolation, and a density-aware budget is novel in this domain. The paper also emphasizes interpretability by reconstructing molecules and analyzing property-target trends. These aspects advance practical imbalanced regression on graphs.

Strengths
- Methodologically coherent use of spectral tools and optimal transport (3.2–3.3).
- Purpose-built budgeting for sparse label regions (3.5).
- Competitive performance with improved rare-range errors (4.2–4.3; Fig. 4).
- Validation via SMILES round-trip and property distributions (4.1; Fig. 3), supporting interpretability.
- Ablation demonstrating importance of alignment and KDE (A.2; Table 6).

Weaknesses
- Chemical validity enforcement depends on RDKit sanitation rather than principled constraints in reconstruction; discretization of multichannel edges is under-specified (3.4, 3.6).
- Abstract/method mismatch on node feature interpolation space (Abstract; Fig. 2 vs. 3.3).
- Baseline comparison fairness unclear (augmentation only in SPECTRA?) and missing statistical rigor (seeds/splits) (4.2; A.3).
- No sensitivity analysis for α (both FGW and spectral mixing) or KDE bandwidth/perc (3.2–3.5).
- Overclaim risk: 100% validity across datasets (Table 1) without reporting failure cases or relaxation rates (3.6).

Questions
- Please reconcile the node feature interpolation discrepancy: spectral-basis vs. node-space (Abstract/Fig. 2 vs. 3.3). What is implemented?
- How are bond types/stereo/conjugation discretized from continuous channel weights (3.1, 3.4)? Thresholds, conflict resolution, and mapping details?
- What train/val/test splits, seeds, and number of runs were used? Are “variances” in Table 4 across seeds or folds?
- Do baselines train with your augmented data? If not, can you include baselines with augmentation for fair comparison?
- Is augmentation runtime included in Fig. 5 (4.4)? Please provide end-to-end runtime including augmentation.
- Sensitivity of results to α (3.2, 3.3), KDE bandwidth, and perc (3.5)? Can you add plots or tables?
- How many augmented samples per dataset were generated, and what proportion required relaxed sanitation (3.6)?
- How do you handle node count mismatch during Hungarian assignment with zero padding (3.2)?

Rating
- Overall (10): 6 — Strong idea and promising results but key methodological/expositional gaps (reconstruction discretization, interpolation space, evaluation fairness) need resolution (3.3–3.4, 4.2; Table 4; Table 1).
- Novelty (10): 7 — Spectral augmentation for imbalanced molecular regression is a meaningful step beyond prior work (2.1–2.2, 2.5).
- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Solid foundation yet incomplete treatment of chemical constraints and sensitivity/fairness analyses (3.4–3.6; 4.2; A.3).
- Clarity (10): 6 — Generally clear but with symbol reuse, typos, and figure/table labeling inconsistencies (3.2–3.3; 4.1–4.2; Block #28; Table 4).
- Confidence (5): 4 — Good confidence based on cross-checking; missing experimental details limit full verification (A.3; 4.2).


Summary
SPECTRA targets imbalanced molecular regression by augmenting sparse target regions via spectral synthesis. The method constructs multichannel Laplacians from SMILES (3.1), aligns molecules using GW/FGW (3.2), interpolates eigenpairs and features (3.3), reconstructs edges (3.4), and uses KDE-derived rarity weights to budget augmentation (3.5). RDKit-based validation ensures chemical plausibility (3.6). A spectral GNN with edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions is trained on original + augmented samples (3.7). Results show valid/novel molecules (4.1; Table 1), competitive MAE/SERA vs. baselines (4.2; Table 4), lower errors in rare ranges (4.3; Fig. 4), and favorable runtime trade-offs (4.4; Fig. 5). Ablations indicate alignment and KDE benefit (A.2; Table 6).

Soundness
The approach is soundly motivated: spectral interpolation offers a principled way to create intermediate graphs, and FGW can align disparate molecules. KDE budgeting is a standard technique for label-density awareness. That said, I verified several aspects that require clarification:
- Edge reconstruction (3.4) transforms Lα to Wα by clipping and then “stacking per-channel features” when any channel is positive; without clear discretization rules, this can produce non-physical multi-attribute assignments. Validity is then enforced by RDKit sanitation (3.6), which is a practical but post-hoc fix that may alter intended structures.
- A mismatch exists between the claimed feature interpolation in a shared spectral basis (Abstract; Fig. 2) and the described node-space interpolation (3.3). This undermines the claimed stability and interpretability of feature synthesis.
- Pair selection (3.5) prioritizes label proximity only; combining with FGW helps, but there is no constraint to prevent interpolations that violate feasible chemistry (e.g., drastic scaffold changes).
- Experimental comparison: If SPECTRA trains on augmented samples and baselines do not (4.2), the comparison could conflate augmentation effects with model architecture. Number of runs/splits is unspecified, and “variance” meanings are unclear (Table 4).

Presentation
Clear narrative and helpful visualizations, but several presentation issues reduce clarity:
- Typos and inconsistent labels (e.g., “Chemb” vs. ChebNet in Table 4; 4.2).
- α overload (FGW balance in 3.2 and spectral mix in 3.3).
- Mixed figure/table references (t-SNE called “Table 3” in Block #28 vs. figures in 30–32).
- Missing details in A.3: splits, seeds, run counts; augmentation percentage perc is not instantiated (3.5).

Contribution
The paper contributes a novel, integrated spectral augmentation approach focused on imbalanced regression in molecular graphs, with interpretability via SMILES reconstruction and property-target analyses. Compared to prior spectral methods (2.2) and imbalance techniques (2.1), the proposed combination is new and potentially impactful for data-scarce regimes in drug discovery.

Strengths
- Technically interesting pipeline combining FGW and spectral synthesis (3.2–3.4).
- Rarity-aware augmentation budget (3.5) directly targets sparse label regions.
- Empirical gains in rare ranges (4.3) with competitive overall MAE and good efficiency (4.4).
- Ablations echo the importance of alignment/KDE (A.2; Table 6).
- Interpretability via valid molecules and property trends (4.1; Fig. 3; Table 1).

Weaknesses
- Reconstruction/discretization of categorical edge attributes is under-specified (3.4), making chemical validity dependent on RDKit sanitation (3.6).
- Feature interpolation space inconsistency (Abstract/Fig. 2 vs. 3.3).
- Unclear fairness and statistical rigor in baseline comparisons (4.2; Table 4), and missing split/run details (A.3).
- No sensitivity analysis for α parameters or KDE bandwidth; no reporting of failure cases despite 100% validity claims (Table 1).

Questions
- Do node features get projected and interpolated in the spectral basis or in node space? Please align Abstract/Fig. 2 and 3.3 and specify the implementation.
- How do you map continuous per-channel adjacency weights to discrete bond types/stereo/conjugation? Are thresholds used? How are conflicts handled?
- What are the data split strategies, number of runs, and seeds? Is variance in Table 4 across runs or folds?
- Do baselines use the same augmented datasets? If not, can you provide a controlled comparison with augmentation for baselines?
- Is the augmentation time included in the runtime plotted in Fig. 5? Please clarify end-to-end time.
- Sensitivity to α (FGW and mixing), KDE bandwidth (Scott’s vs. tuned), and perc need reporting.
- Given 100% validity in Table 1, how many augmented molecules were generated, and what were sanitation failure or relaxation rates?

Rating
- Overall (10): 6 — A promising and novel approach with useful empirical improvements, but reconstruction details, feature interpolation consistency, and evaluation rigor need clarification (3.3–3.4; 4.2; Table 1; Table 4).
- Novelty (10): 8 — Spectral augmentation tailored to imbalanced molecular regression is novel relative to existing spectral and imbalance methods (2.1–2.2).
- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Solid foundations but missing details on discretization, constraints, and sensitivity/fairness analyses (3.4–3.6; 4.2; A.3).
- Clarity (10): 6 — Good structure yet marred by symbol reuse, typos, and reference inconsistencies (3.2–3.3; 4.1–4.2; Block #28; Table 4).
- Confidence (5): 3 — Moderate confidence; several implementation/evaluation details are unclear and need author clarification (A.3; 3.3; 3.4; 4.2).


Summary
This paper proposes SPECTRA, a spectral-domain, target-aware augmentation pipeline for molecular property regression under label imbalance. The method: (i) parses SMILES to multichannel graphs (3.1), (ii) aligns molecules via GW/FGW couplings (3.2), (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenpairs and features (3.3), (iv) reconstructs graphs and labels (3.4), (v) uses KDE-based rarity weights to allocate augmentation (3.5), (vi) validates molecules by RDKit sanitation (3.6), and (vii) trains an edge-aware Chebyshev spectral GNN (3.7). Experiments over ESOL, FreeSolv, Lipo analyze validity/novelty, property trends, MAE/SERA vs. baselines, error across target ranges, and efficiency (4.1–4.4). Ablations evaluate augmentation, alignment, and KDE prior (A.2).

Soundness
The methodology leverages appropriate tools (FGW, Procrustes/QR) and addresses imbalanced regression via rarity-aware augmentation. The spectral interpolation of eigenvalues/bases is mathematically coherent, and clipping yields nonnegative adjacencies. Yet, careful verification exposes gaps:
- The reconstructed adjacencies may not preserve graph-theoretic Laplacian constraints and lack principled discretization from continuous channel weights to categorical chemistry (3.4). RDKit sanitation (3.6) is necessary but could mask structural artifacts.
- Abstract/Fig. 2 imply spectral-basis interpolation for features, while 3.3 states node-space interpolation; if the implementation is node-space, the claimed spectral stability for features is overstated.
- Pair selection by label proximity (3.5) risks implausible interpolants; combining label closeness with structural similarity metrics (beyond FGW) could be more robust.
- Experimental clarity: It’s unclear if baselines see augmented data; number of runs and split protocol are missing (4.2; A.3). The 100% validity claim (Table 1) needs context (sample counts, sanitation mode).

Presentation
The paper reads well and the visualizations are useful. Issues include:
- Naming inconsistency (“Chemb” vs. ChebNet; Table 4).
- α reused across different roles (3.2 vs. 3.3).
- t-SNE visualization called “Table 3” in text (Block #28) but shown as figures (30–32).
- Missing specifics on splits/seeds/runs; augmentation percent (perc) is not instantiated.
- Runtime accounting (4.4) does not clarify inclusion of augmentation cost.

Contribution
A notable contribution is the explicit use of spectral interpolation for augmentation to handle regression imbalance in molecular graphs, with interpretability via SMILES conversion and property analyses. The blend of GW/FGW alignment, spectral synthesis, and rarity-aware budgeting advances practice in data-scarce scientific regimes.

Strengths
- Principled spectral alignment/interpolation pipeline (3.2–3.4).
- Clear focus on imbalanced regression with KDE budgeting (3.5).
- Competitive MAE/SERA and improved rare-range error (4.2–4.3; Fig. 4).
- Efficiency gains vs. transformer baselines (4.4; Fig. 5).
- Ablation supports design choices (A.2; Table 6) and interpretability through property-target plots (4.1; Fig. 3).

Weaknesses
- Reconstruction specifics for categorical edge attributes are insufficient (3.4), making chemical validity reliant on RDKit sanitation (3.6).
- Feature interpolation inconsistency (Abstract/Fig. 2 vs. 3.3).
- Unclear experimental fairness and statistical reporting (4.2; A.3; Table 4).
- No sensitivity analyses for key hyperparameters (α, KDE bandwidth, perc).
- Overly strong validity claim (Table 1) without failure analysis or counts.

Questions
- Please clarify the actual feature interpolation space (spectral vs. node) and update text/figures accordingly.
- Provide the exact edge discretization process: thresholds for channel weights, mapping to bond types/stereo/conjugation, and conflict resolution.
- Detail splits, seeds, runs; explain “variance” in Table 4. Are results averaged over multiple random splits?
- Do baselines receive augmented data? If not, can you supply augmentation-enabled baselines?
- Is augmentation time counted in Fig. 5? Please report end-to-end time and the cost of GW/FGW alignment.
- Sensitivity to α parameters, KDE bandwidth (Scott vs. tuned), and augmentation rate perc would strengthen claims.
- How many augmented molecules were generated per dataset, and what proportion required relaxed sanitation (3.6)? Any examples of failure cases?

Rating
- Overall (10): 7 — A solid and creative approach with encouraging results, tempered by reconstruction/feature interpolation inconsistencies and evaluation detail gaps (3.3–3.4; 4.2; Table 1; Table 4).
- Novelty (10): 8 — Spectral, geometry-aware augmentation focused on imbalanced regression is a fresh contribution beyond prior spectral augmentation and imbalance work (2.1–2.2).
- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Foundations are sound, but missing discretization details, sensitivity studies, and fairness clarifications limit strength (3.4–3.6; 4.2; A.3).
- Clarity (10): 7 — Well written overall with helpful visuals; minor inconsistencies and missing experimental specifics reduce clarity (Block #28; Table 4; 3.2–3.3).
- Confidence (5): 3 — Moderate; several key implementation and evaluation specifics need clarification for full verification.


Summary
The paper introduces SPECTRA, a spectral-domain augmentation framework that synthesizes intermediate molecular graphs to densify sparse target regions in imbalanced regression. It builds multichannel Laplacians from SMILES (3.1), aligns pairs using GW/FGW (3.2), interpolates eigenpairs and node features (3.3), reconstructs edges and labels (3.4), allocates augmentation via KDE rarity weights (3.5), validates molecules with RDKit sanitation (3.6), and trains an edge-aware Chebyshev spectral GNN (3.7). Experiments on ESOL/FreeSolv/Lipo report high validity/novelty, competitive MAE/SERA, improved rare-range errors, and favorable runtime (4.1–4.4), with ablations showing benefits of alignment and KDE (A.2).

Soundness
Conceptually well motivated: spectral interpolation provides a path for generating coherent intermediates, and FGW alignment establishes correspondences. KDE for rarity-aware budgeting is reasonable. Nonetheless, several points deserve scrutiny:
- The adjacency reconstruction (3.4) from Lα via clipping and channel stacking lacks a principled mechanism to ensure categorical bond/stereo/conjugation validity; reliance on RDKit sanitation (3.6) may correct violations but can alter the augmented graph distribution unpredictably.
- Inconsistency in feature interpolation description: spectral-basis vs. node-space (Abstract; Fig. 2 vs. 3.3).
- Pairing by label proximity alone (3.5) may neglect chemical plausibility; no constraint is imposed on chemical distance or scaffold similarity beyond FGW alignment.
- Comparative evaluation does not state whether baselines receive augmented data (4.2), and reporting of variance lacks split/run details (A.3), which affects interpretability of statistical significance.
- The 100% validity claim (Table 1) across datasets is unusual; failure counts or sanitation mode breakdowns would help.

Presentation
Strong visuals and logical structure, but clarity issues remain:
- Typos/inconsistent labels (Table 4 “Chemb” vs. ChebNet; 4.2).
- α overload for different roles (3.2, 3.3).
- Mislabeling t-SNE as “Table 3” (Block #28) with plots shown in Fig. 30–32.
- Experimental setup does not specify split strategies, seeds, runs, or whether augmentation runtime is included (A.3; 4.4).

Contribution
The work advances imbalanced molecular regression by proposing spectral, geometry-aware augmentation targeted at rare labels and demonstrating interpretability via reconstruction and property analyses. This integration has practical significance for drug discovery datasets where rare values matter.

Strengths
- Well-integrated pipeline leveraging FGW and spectral interpolation (3.2–3.4).
- Rarity-aware augmentation focused on underrepresented targets (3.5).
- Improved performance in sparse regions with competitive overall MAE and solid efficiency (4.2–4.4; Fig. 4, Fig. 5).
- Ablation evidence supports design choices (A.2; Table 6).
- Property-target trend consistency indicates plausible augmentation behavior (4.1; Fig. 3).

Weaknesses
- Limited detail on discrete edge attribute reconstruction and potential multi-channel conflicts (3.4), making chemical validity heavily dependent on RDKit sanitation (3.6).
- Feature interpolation inconsistency between sections (Abstract/Fig. 2 vs. 3.3).
- Fairness and statistical rigor of baseline comparisons are unclear (4.2; Table 4; A.3).
- Lack of sensitivity analysis to α parameters, KDE bandwidth, and augmentation rate perc (3.2–3.5).
- Overly strong validity claim without failure analysis (Table 1).

Questions
- Which feature interpolation is implemented—spectral basis or node space? Please reconcile Abstract/Fig. 2 with 3.3.
- How do you discretize continuous channel weights into specific bond types/stereo/conjugation, and what thresholds/conflict policies are used (3.4)?
- What is the exact split protocol (train/val/test), number of runs, and seeds? Are reported variances across runs or folds (Table 4)?
- Did baselines receive augmented data? If not, can you provide baselines trained with augmentation for fairness?
- Is augmentation time included in runtime comparisons (4.4; Fig. 5)? Please provide end-to-end timings and alignment costs.
- Can you provide sensitivity analysis for α (GW/FGW and spectral mixing), KDE bandwidth, and perc, and possibly for neighbor selection criteria in 3.5?
- How many molecules were augmented per dataset, and what fraction required relaxed RDKit sanitation or failed (3.6)?

Rating
- Overall (10): 7 — Strong idea with practical impact and promising results, but methodological ambiguities and evaluation details (feature interpolation, edge discretization, fairness/statistics) need clarification (3.3–3.4; 4.2; Table 1).
- Novelty (10): 8 — Integrating spectral augmentation with rarity-aware budgeting for molecular regression is novel relative to prior art (2.1–2.2, 2.5).
- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Solid foundations; missing constraints and sensitivity/fairness analyses limit strength (3.4–3.6; 4.2; A.3).
- Clarity (10): 7 — Clear overall with helpful figures, yet marred by symbol reuse and labeling inconsistencies (Block #28; Table 4; 3.2–3.3).
- Confidence (5): 3 — Moderate; several implementation and evaluation specifics require author clarification to fully verify claims.
