This leads to a different judgment on the paper's soundness, resulting in a high-moderate overall match."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the innovative spectral augmentation approach for imbalanced regression, the target-aware sampling using KDE, and the method's computational efficiency. Review B provides more granular detail and evidence for these points, but the fundamental contributions highlighted are identical to Review A.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the lack of formal guarantees for generating chemically valid molecules and concerns about scalability to larger datasets. However, Review B introduces several major, distinct weaknesses absent from Review A, such as insufficient experimental rigor (missing seeds, unclear baseline tuning) and reliance on qualitative visual evidence.",
          "overall": "The reviews align very strongly on the paper's strengths but only moderately on its weaknesses, as Review B offers a much more comprehensive and methodologically-focused critique. The overall judgment is largely consistent—viewing the paper as a promising contribution with notable flaws—but the specific evidence and focus of the critiques diverge significantly."

Review B offers more granular detail, but the key highlighted contributions are identical to Review A's.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the lack of formal guarantees for chemical validity and concerns about scalability as primary weaknesses. However, Review B introduces several major critiques absent from Review A, including insufficient statistical rigor in the evaluation, unclear baseline comparisons, and a lack of quantitative analysis for visualizations.",

While they share key technical weaknesses, Review B provides a much more comprehensive critique of the experimental evaluation, but their overall judgment on the method's novelty and potential remains largely consistent."
