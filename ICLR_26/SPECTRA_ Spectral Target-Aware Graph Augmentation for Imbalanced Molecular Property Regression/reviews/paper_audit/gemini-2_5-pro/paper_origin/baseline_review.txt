1) Summary
The paper introduces SPECTRA, a novel graph augmentation framework for imbalanced molecular property regression. The core problem is that standard GNNs perform poorly on rare but scientifically valuable molecules, and existing oversampling methods can distort molecular structures. SPECTRA addresses this by generating synthetic molecules in the spectral domain. It aligns pairs of molecules using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein transport to find node correspondences, then interpolates their Laplacian eigensystems and node features. A rarity-aware sampling strategy, based on a kernel density estimate of the target labels, focuses augmentation on sparse regions of the target space. The resulting synthetic graphs are shown to be chemically valid and structurally diverse. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that training a spectral GNN on the augmented data improves prediction accuracy in underrepresented target ranges while maintaining competitive overall performance and computational efficiency.2) Strengths
*   **Novel and Well-Motivated Methodology**
    *   The core idea of performing graph interpolation in the spectral domain to preserve global topological structure is a novel approach to data augmentation for molecular graphs (Section 3.3). This is well-motivated by the limitations of spatial or latent-space methods that can produce invalid or distorted structures (Section 1).
    *   The use of (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport for geometry-aware graph matching is a principled way to establish node correspondences between structurally different molecules before interpolation (Section 3.2, Figure 2). This is a sophisticated and appropriate choice for the problem.
    *   The rarity-aware pair selection mechanism, which uses a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) to assign an augmentation budget, directly targets the problem of imbalanced regression by focusing resources on low-density regions of the label space (Section 3.5).*   **Thorough Evaluation of Generation Quality**
    *   The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the generated molecules, which builds significant confidence in the augmentation process itself, beyond its downstream utility. This includes quantitative metrics showing high validity (100%), uniqueness, and novelty across all datasets (Table 1).
    *   The analysis of structural properties (atom and ring counts in Table 2) and chemical properties (LogP, SA, QED, etc., in Figure 3) demonstrates that the augmented molecules are diverse yet chemically plausible, respecting the underlying property-target correlations of the original data.
    *   Visualizations using t-SNE on Morgan fingerprints clearly show that the augmented samples populate sparse regions of the chemical space, providing qualitative evidence that the method is densifying the feature space as intended (Figure 3, Blocks 30-32).*   **Rigorous and Multi-Faceted Experimental Analysis**
    *   The evaluation covers multiple important aspects of model performance. It assesses not only overall accuracy (MAE in Table 4) but also performance specifically on imbalanced data using the SERA metric (Table 4) and by analyzing error distribution across target ranges (Figure 4).
    *   The inclusion of a computational efficiency analysis (Figure 5) provides a practical perspective, showing that SPECTRA achieves a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off and lies on or near the Pareto frontier, outperforming costly models like Molformer.
    *   The ablation study effectively demonstrates the importance of the key components of the proposed method, namely the geometry-aware alignment (FGW) and the KDE-based rarity-aware sampling (Table 6, Appendix A.2).*   **High Clarity and Interpretability**
    *   The proposed pipeline is explained clearly and is well-summarized in a helpful diagram (Figure 2), making the complex workflow easy to follow.
    *   A key strength of the method is its interpretability. Unlike latent-space augmentation methods, SPECTRA generates explicit graph structures that can be converted back to SMILES strings and validated using domain tools like RDKit (Section 3.6). This allows for direct inspection of the synthetic data, which is crucial for trust and adoption in scientific domains.3) Weaknesses
*   **Inconsistent and Confusing Presentation of Figures and Tables**
    *   There are multiple inconsistencies in the numbering and referencing of figures and tables, which significantly hinders readability. For example, the text in Section 4.1 refers to "Figure 3" for both t-SNE plots and joint distribution plots, but the plots themselves are scattered and labeled differently (e.g., the t-SNE plots are captioned as "Table 3" in Block 28).
    *   The target distribution plots mentioned as "Figure 1" in Section 1 are located in the Related Work section (Blocks 6, 7, 8) and are not explicitly labeled as Figure 1.
    *   The notation described for Table 4 in the text ("underlined indicate the second best") does not match the actual table, which uses asterisks and italics (Block 33). These presentation errors make it difficult to follow the experimental evidence.*   **Limited Comparison to Alternative Augmentation Strategies**
    *   While the paper compares the downstream performance of SPECTRA against several state-of-the-art GNNs (Table 4), it lacks a direct comparison of the augmentation strategy itself against other relevant baselines.
    *   The related work mentions SMOGN (Section 2.1), a classic method for imbalanced regression, but no graph-based adaptation of SMOGN or other graph-specific oversampling techniques are included in the experimental comparison.
    *   Without these baselines, it is difficult to fully attribute the performance gains to the specific spectral interpolation approach versus a simpler graph augmentation scheme (e.g., feature interpolation or simple topological perturbations) also guided by the KDE-based sampler.*   **Potential Scalability and Generalizability Issues are Unaddressed**
    *   The core components of the method, namely pairwise graph matching with FGW and full eigendecomposition of the Laplacian (Sections 3.2, 3.3), are computationally intensive and may not scale well to larger graphs.
    *   The experiments are conducted on molecular datasets with relatively small graphs (e.g., max 115 atoms, Table 2). The paper does not discuss the computational complexity or potential scalability limitations of the approach for larger molecules or different types of graph data (e.g., social networks).
    *   The method's reliance on RDKit for graph construction and validation (Sections 3.1, 3.6) tightly couples it to the molecular domain, and the paper does not discuss how the approach might be generalized to other domains where such validation tools are unavailable.*   **Ambiguity in Key Methodological Steps**
    *   The process of converting the soft correspondence matrix from FGW into a hard one-to-one mapping using the Hungarian algorithm is a critical step but is described too briefly (Section 3.2). The potential impact of this discretization on the final alignment quality is not discussed.
    *   The graph reconstruction step (Section 3.4) uses a standard but potentially lossy procedure to recover a weighted adjacency matrix from the interpolated Laplacian. The paper does not acknowledge or analyze any potential structural artifacts or information loss that might occur during this reconstruction.
    *   The neighbor selection strategy for interpolation (sorting by target value difference, Section 3.5) is heuristic. While intuitive, there is no justification provided for why this is preferable to other strategies, such as pairing based on structural similarity in addition to label similarity.4) Suggestions for Improvement
*   **Revise and Proofread all Figures and Tables**
    *   Please perform a thorough review of all figures and tables. Ensure that they are numbered sequentially and consistently referenced in the main text. For example, combine the three t-SNE plots into a single, clearly labeled Figure and update all references accordingly.
    *   Correct the caption for the target distribution plots and place them appropriately (e.g., in the Experiments or Appendix section if they are part of the dataset description).
    *   Ensure that the description of formatting in tables (e.g., bold, underline, italics) in the text perfectly matches the formatting used in the table itself (Table 4).*   **Strengthen Experimental Baselines for Augmentation**
    *   To better isolate the contribution of the spectral interpolation method, please include baseline comparisons against other graph augmentation techniques for imbalanced regression.
    *   This could include a graph-based adaptation of SMOGN, where interpolation is performed on node features or graph embeddings between pairs of graphs selected with the same KDE-based strategy.
    *   Adding such baselines would provide a more direct and convincing demonstration of the superiority of the proposed spectral approach over simpler alternatives.*   **Add a Discussion on Limitations and Scalability**
    *   Include a paragraph in the method or conclusion section discussing the computational complexity of the augmentation pipeline, particularly the FGW and eigendecomposition steps.
    *   Acknowledge the potential scalability challenges for graphs significantly larger than those in the current benchmarks and suggest this as an area for future work (e.g., using approximate solvers for OT or sparsification for spectral methods).
    *   Briefly comment on the generalizability of the framework beyond molecular graphs, noting which components (like RDKit validation) are domain-specific and which are general.*   **Elaborate on Ambiguous Methodological Details**
    *   In Section 3.2, please add a sentence to clarify the discretization of the transport plan, for instance, mentioning how it handles non-square matrices or the potential impact of forcing a hard assignment.
    *   In Section 3.4, briefly acknowledge the nature of the graph reconstruction step and comment on its fidelity, perhaps citing work that analyzes this process or noting that the high validity rates (Table 1) suggest it is effective in practice.
    *   In Section 3.5, add a brief justification for the choice of pairing molecules based solely on target value proximity, and perhaps mention alternative strategies that were considered or could be explored in future work.5) Score
