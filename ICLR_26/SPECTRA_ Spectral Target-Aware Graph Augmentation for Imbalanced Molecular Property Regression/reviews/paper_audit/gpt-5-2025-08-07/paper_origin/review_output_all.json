  "baseline_review": "Summary\nThe paper addresses imbalanced molecular property regression, where rare but high-value targets are underrepresented. It proposes SPECTRA, a spectral target-aware graph augmentation framework that (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns graph pairs via (Fused) Gromov–Wasserstein (FGW) couplings; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues/eigenvectors and node features in an aligned basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize molecules with interpolated targets. A KDE-derived rarity-aware budgeting scheme concentrates augmentation in low-density label regions and a spectral GNN with edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions trains on original/augmented data. Experiments on ESOL, FreeSolv, and Lipo report 100% validity of generated molecules, competitive MAE, improved error in sparse target ranges, and favorable runtime–accuracy trade-offs (Sections 3.1–3.7; Figures 2–5; Tables 1–4, 6; Appendix A.1–A.3).Strengths\n- Bolded title: **Coherent spectral augmentation pipeline grounded in graph geometry**\n  - The end-to-end workflow—FGW matching, spectral alignment, interpolation, and reconstruction—is clearly presented (Figure 2; Sections 3.2–3.4), supporting technical soundness and reproducibility.\n  - Use of orthogonal Procrustes alignment and QR re-orthonormalization to stabilize eigenbasis interpolation (Section 3.3) reflects careful handling of spectral ambiguities (signs/basis), improving robustness.\n  - Multi-channel Laplacian handling for edge attributes (bond type, stereo, conjugation) (Sections 3.1, 3.4) preserves molecular topology across channels, contributing to plausibility.- Bolded title: **Target-aware augmentation via KDE budgeting for imbalance**\n  - Rarity-aware weights from label KDE and per-sample budgets (Section 3.5; Figure 1 mentions KDE setup) focus augmentation where labels are scarce, addressing imbalanced regression with a principled allocation.\n  - Pair selection by nearest targets |y_i − y_j| (Section 3.5) improves label-consistency of synthetic intermediates, which matters for regression fidelity.\n  - Ablation shows KDE-based augmentation contributes to performance in imbalanced regions (Appendix A.2; Table 6), supporting impact.- Bolded title: **Interpretability and chemical validity of synthesized molecules**\n  - Conversion back to SMILES with RDKit sanitization and explicit atom/bond decoding (Section 3.6) enables inspection, increasing trust and interpretability.\n  - Empirical validity is reported as 100% across datasets, with high uniqueness/novelty (Section 4.1; Table 1), which matters for practical augmentation without duplicates.\n  - Structural statistics (atom/ring counts) demonstrate larger and more cyclic structures in augmented sets while remaining reasonable (Section 4.1; Table 2), suggesting realistic scaffold diversity.- Bolded title: **Competitive predictive performance with stronger behavior in sparse regimes**\n  - MAE and SERA scores across ESOL/FreeSolv/Lipo show SPECTRA competitive with strong baselines (Section 4.2; Table 4), indicating effective learning.\n  - Detailed per-range MAE analysis (Figure 4) shows reduced errors in low-density target intervals, directly addressing imbalance (Section 4.3).\n  - SPECTRA matches the best Lipo SERA and is second-best on several metrics (Table 4), showing useful balance between global accuracy and rare-region fidelity.- Bolded title: **Efficiency and Pareto positioning**\n  - Runtime vs MAE plots place SPECTRA on/near the Pareto frontier across datasets (Section 4.4; Figure 5), underscoring efficiency relative to transformers while maintaining accuracy.\n  - Hardware and implementation details (Appendix A.3) provide context for efficiency claims, aiding reproducibility and fair comparison.\n  - The pipeline’s spectral operations coupled with ChebConv (Section 3.7) avoid heavy transformer overhead while leveraging spectral expressiveness.- Bolded title: **Ablation substantiates design choices**\n  - Removing FGW alignment notably harms FreeSolv performance (Appendix A.2; Table 6), evidencing necessity of geometry-aware alignment for structurally diverse molecules.\n  - KDE prior improves ESOL performance and stabilizes Lipo (Appendix A.2; Table 6), showing augmentation allocation matters.\n  - Full model achieves best/near-best across datasets (Appendix A.2; Table 6), consolidating the contribution of each component.Weaknesses\n- Bolded title: **Limited methodological guarantees for reconstruction and chemical plausibility**\n  - The adjacency reconstruction uses clipping from interpolated Laplacians (Section 3.4) without theoretical guarantees on preserving chemically valid bond constraints or graph simplicity; empirical RDKit sanitization is used but no formal proof is given. This raises technical soundness concerns.\n  - Chemical validity relies solely on RDKit sanitization (Section 3.6), and the reported 100% validity (Table 1) is not accompanied by qualitative failure analysis or constraints ensuring valence/aromaticity during spectral interpolation. This affects trustworthiness in edge cases.\n  - Label interpolation y_α = (1−α)y_A + α y_B (Section 3.4) lacks justification that physical properties vary linearly between paired molecules; no direct evidence of physical validity beyond joint plots is provided, affecting scientific rigor. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.- Bolded title: **Incomplete detail on spectral interpolation and multi-channel handling**\n  - Eigenvector selection/alignment (k, ordering, handling of close or repeated eigenvalues) is not fully described (Section 3.3), limiting clarity on stability in degenerate spectra—important for technical robustness. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.\n  - The integration of three edge-specific Laplacians into a single ChebConv operates with “A” and “w_e” (Section 3.7) but does not specify how multi-channel adjacencies are aggregated/weighted for convolution, affecting clarity and reproducibility.\n  - Computational complexity and numerical stability of repeated eigendecompositions per channel/pair are not analyzed (Sections 3.3–3.4), and the runtime plots (Figure 5) do not separate augmentation vs training costs, limiting interpretability of efficiency.- Bolded title: **Evaluation scope and fairness details are under-specified**\n  - Table 4 reports “mean ± var” without stating number of runs/seeds or significance tests (Section 4.2), limiting statistical confidence in comparative claims.\n  - Hyperparameter tuning is detailed for SPECTRA (Appendix A.3) but baseline tuning protocols are not described; it is unclear whether baselines received comparable search budgets, impacting fairness.\n  - Train/validation/test split strategies and potential scaffold splits are not specified (Appendix A.1, A.3), which affects generalization assessment and comparability across runs. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.- Bolded title: **Coverage and correlation analyses rely on qualitative visuals without quantitative metrics**\n  - t-SNE plots of Morgan fingerprints (Figure 3; Section 4.1) illustrate coverage but lack quantitative measures (e.g., distribution distances or coverage scores), weakening the evidence of broader chemical space coverage.\n  - Property–target joint plots (Figure 3) are used to assert trend preservation, but no correlation coefficients or regression analyses are provided; claims remain qualitative (Section 4.1).\n  - The per-range MAE (Figure 4) is visual; numerical summaries or statistical tests (e.g., confidence intervals) are absent, limiting rigor of rare-region improvement claims.- Bolded title: **Rarity-aware budgeting lacks specification and sensitivity analysis**\n  - KDE bandwidth choice is not reported in Section 3.5 (Figure 1 uses Scott’s rule-of-thumb for illustration), and there is no sensitivity study on bandwidth’s impact on rarity weights, affecting robustness.\n  - The augmentation rate “perc” and total budget “N” (Section 3.5) are not instantiated in experiments (Appendix A.3 does not list perc), limiting reproducibility.\n  - Pair selection by |y_i − y_j| (Section 3.5) may bias to near-neighbors and risk limited diversity; no mechanism is described to avoid repeated augmentation of similar scaffolds or to ensure coverage of structurally diverse pairs.- Bolded title: **Generality and comparisons are limited**\n  - Datasets are relatively small to medium (Appendix A.1; Table 5: ESOL 1,128; FreeSolv 642; Lipo 4,200), and there is no evaluation on larger or more complex datasets, limiting external validity.\n  - 3D features and multi-property settings are noted as future work (Section 5) but not demonstrated; the current approach uses 2D graphs with limited geometric constraints (Section 3.1).\n  - Although spectral augmentation is discussed in related work (Section 2.2; Yang et al., 2024), the experimental baselines do not include a spectral augmentation method, limiting novelty positioning via direct comparison.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Bolded title: **Strengthen guarantees and empirical validation of reconstruction and label interpolation**\n  - Provide theoretical analysis or constraints ensuring that W_α reconstruction (Section 3.4) preserves graph simplicity and chemically valid bond configurations; for instance, enforce valence-aware edge pruning and demonstrate with failure cases from RDKit sanitization.\n  - Augment validity assessment (Section 3.6; Table 1) with qualitative/quantitative error analysis (e.g., reasons for any failures if present), and include checks of aromaticity/valence consistency pre- and post-sanitization to bolster trust.\n  - Justify or evaluate label interpolation (Section 3.4) by computing correlations of y_α with computed properties or running property prediction baselines on synthetic molecules to verify physical plausibility; report results alongside Figure 3.- Bolded title: **Clarify spectral interpolation choices and multi-channel integration**\n  - Specify eigenvector set size k, ordering strategy, and handling of near-eigenvalue multiplicities (Section 3.3), including sensitivity experiments to sign/ordering ambiguities and their effect on reconstruction.\n  - Detail how the three edge-specific adjacencies are combined for convolution (Section 3.7)—e.g., channel-wise ChebConv with learned weights or concatenation—so others can reproduce the edge-aware mechanism.\n  - Report augmentation-time breakdown (eigendecomposition per channel/pair) vs training-time costs, and include numerical stability diagnostics (e.g., condition numbers, orthogonality checks) to substantiate efficiency claims beyond Figure 5.- Bolded title: **Improve evaluation rigor and fairness**\n  - State the number of runs/seeds for Table 4, switch “var” to standard deviation, and add statistical tests (e.g., paired t-test or bootstrap) to support claims of improvements (Section 4.2).\n  - Describe baseline hyperparameter search spaces/protocols to ensure comparable tuning (Appendix A.3), or cite canonical configs when applicable; include ablations showing SPECTRA robustness under reduced tuning budgets.\n  - Clarify split strategies (random/scaffold/time-split) and report metrics by split to assess generalization; if scaffold splits are used, note whether augmented molecules respect split boundaries (Appendix A.1, A.3).- Bolded title: **Add quantitative coverage and correlation metrics**\n  - Complement t-SNE visuals (Figure 3) with quantitative measures such as coverage ratios over binning of fingerprints, KL divergence between original and augmented molecular property distributions, or nearest-neighbor diversity indices (Section 4.1).\n  - Compute correlation coefficients (Pearson/Spearman) or simple regressions for property–target relationships for both original and augmented sets and report shifts to substantiate “trend preservation” (Figure 3).\n  - Provide numerical per-range MAE tables with confidence intervals for Figure 4 and test for significance of rare-range improvements to strengthen RQ3 claims.- Bolded title: **Specify and test rarity-aware budgeting choices**\n  - Report the KDE bandwidth used in Section 3.5 and conduct sensitivity analysis over multiple bandwidths (including Scott’s rule-of-thumb noted in Figure 1) to show robustness of rarity weights.\n  - Explicitly state augmentation rate “perc” and total budget “N” used in experiments (Appendix A.3), and evaluate performance as these parameters vary to guide practitioners.\n  - Introduce diversity-aware pair selection (e.g., structural dissimilarity thresholds, scaffold-aware pairing) to avoid overfitting to local neighborhoods; measure its effect on uniqueness/novelty (Table 1–2).- Bolded title: **Broaden generality and comparative baselines**\n  - Evaluate on larger datasets (e.g., other MoleculeNet tasks) or industrial-scale collections to test scalability beyond Table 5 sizes (Appendix A.1), and report runtime scaling curves alongside Figure 5.\n  - Incorporate 3D geometric features (e.g., coordinates or distance matrices) into Laplacian channels (Section 3.1) and test their effect, aligning with the stated future direction (Section 5).\n  - Add baselines that reflect spectral augmentation or imbalanced regression strategies referenced in Section 2.2 (e.g., Yang et al., 2024) to position SPECTRA’s novelty via direct comparison.Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Competitive performance with clear geometric augmentation (Figure 2; Table 4; Figure 4) and strong validity/efficiency evidence (Table 1; Figure 5), tempered by missing guarantees and evaluation details (Sections 3.4, 3.6; Appendix A.3).\n- Novelty (10): 7 — Combining FGW alignment, spectral interpolation, and KDE-based rarity budgeting (Sections 3.2–3.5; Section 2.5) is distinctive, though direct comparisons to related spectral augmentation work are absent (Section 2.2).\n- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Method is well-motivated with ablations (Table 6) and stable alignment steps (Section 3.3), but lacks theoretical guarantees for reconstruction/label interpolation and detailed complexity analyses (Sections 3.4, 3.6; Figure 5).\n- Clarity (10): 7 — The pipeline and experiments are generally clear (Figure 2; Sections 3.1–3.7; Tables 1–4), yet key implementation/evaluation specifics (baseline tuning, splits, augmentation parameters) are under-specified (Appendix A.3;

Experiments on ESOL, FreeSolv, and Lipo report 100% validity of generated molecules, competitive MAE, improved error in sparse target ranges, and favorable runtime–accuracy trade-offs (Sections 3.1–3.7; Figures 2–5; Tables 1–4, 6; Appendix A.1–A.3).Strengths\n- **Coherent spectral augmentation pipeline grounded in graph geometry**\n  - The end-to-end workflow—FGW matching, spectral alignment, interpolation, and reconstruction—is clearly presented (Figure 2; Sections 3.2–3.4), supporting technical soundness and reproducibility.\n  - Use of orthogonal Procrustes alignment and QR re-orthonormalization to stabilize eigenbasis interpolation (Section 3.3) reflects careful handling of spectral ambiguities (signs/basis), improving robustness.\n  - Multi-channel Laplacian handling for edge attributes (bond type, stereo, conjugation) (Sections 3.1, 3.4) preserves molecular topology across channels, contributing to plausibility.\n- **Target-aware augmentation via KDE budgeting for imbalance**\n  - Rarity-aware weights from label KDE and per-sample budgets (Section 3.5; Figure 1 mentions KDE setup) focus augmentation where labels are scarce, addressing imbalanced regression with a principled allocation.\n  - Pair selection by nearest targets |y_i − y_j| (Section 3.5) improves label-consistency of synthetic intermediates, which matters for regression fidelity.\n  - Ablation shows KDE-based augmentation contributes to performance in imbalanced regions (Appendix A.2; Table 6), supporting impact.\n- **Interpretability and chemical validity of synthesized molecules**\n  - Conversion back to SMILES with RDKit sanitization and explicit atom/bond decoding (Section 3.6) enables inspection, increasing trust and interpretability.\n  - Empirical validity is reported as 100% across datasets, with high uniqueness/novelty (Section 4.1; Table 1), which matters for practical augmentation without duplicates.\n  - Structural statistics (atom/ring counts) indicate increased mean atoms/rings for FreeSolv and ESOL and comparable ranges for Lipo (Section 4.1; Table 2), suggesting realistic scaffold diversity while avoiding extreme deviations.\n- **Competitive predictive performance with stronger behavior in sparse regimes**\n  - MAE and SERA scores across ESOL/FreeSolv/Lipo show SPECTRA competitive with strong baselines (Section 4.2; Table 4), indicating effective learning.\n  - Detailed per-range MAE analysis (Figure 4) shows reduced errors in low-density target intervals, directly addressing imbalance (Section 4.3).\n  - SPECTRA matches the best Lipo SERA and is second-best on several metrics (Table 4), showing useful balance between global accuracy and rare-region fidelity.\n- **Efficiency and Pareto positioning**\n  - Runtime vs MAE plots place SPECTRA on/near the Pareto frontier across datasets (Section 4.4; Figure 5), underscoring efficiency relative to transformers while maintaining accuracy.\n  - Hardware and implementation details (Appendix A.3) provide context for efficiency claims, aiding reproducibility and fair comparison.\n  - The pipeline’s spectral operations coupled with ChebConv (Section 3.7) avoid heavy transformer overhead while leveraging spectral expressiveness.\n- **Ablation substantiates design choices**\n  - Removing FGW alignment notably harms FreeSolv performance (Appendix A.2; Table 6), evidencing necessity of geometry-aware alignment for structurally diverse molecules.\n  - KDE prior improves ESOL performance and stabilizes Lipo (Appendix A.2; Table 6), showing augmentation allocation matters.\n  - Full model achieves best/near-best across datasets (Appendix A.2; Table 6), consolidating the contribution of each component.Weaknesses\n- **Limited methodological guarantees for reconstruction and chemical plausibility**\n  - The adjacency reconstruction uses clipping from interpolated Laplacians (Section 3.4) without theoretical guarantees on preserving chemically valid bond constraints or graph simplicity; empirical RDKit sanitization is used but no formal proof is given. This raises technical soundness concerns.\n  - Chemical validity relies solely on RDKit sanitization (Section 3.6), and the reported 100% validity (Table 1) is not accompanied by qualitative failure analysis or constraints ensuring valence/aromaticity during spectral interpolation. This affects trustworthiness in edge cases.\n  - Label interpolation y_α = (1−α)y_A + α y_B (Section 3.4) lacks justification that physical properties vary linearly between paired molecules; no direct evidence of physical validity beyond joint plots is provided, affecting scientific rigor. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.\n  - The discretization/quantization of continuous per-channel edge weights back into discrete bond type/stereochemistry/conjugation is not specified (Sections 3.4–3.6), which directly impacts chemical plausibility of reconstructed edges and the validity claim.\n- **Incomplete detail on spectral interpolation and multi-channel handling**\n  - Eigenvector selection/alignment (k, ordering, handling of close or repeated eigenvalues) is not fully described (Section 3.3), limiting clarity on stability in degenerate spectra—important for technical robustness. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.\n  - The integration of three edge-specific Laplacians into a single ChebConv operates with “A” and “w_e” (Section 3.7) but does not specify how multi-channel adjacencies are aggregated/weighted for convolution, affecting clarity and reproducibility.\n  - Computational complexity and numerical stability of repeated eigendecompositions per channel/pair are not analyzed (Sections 3.3–3.4), and the runtime plots (Figure 5) do not separate augmentation vs training costs, limiting interpretability of efficiency.\n  - The symbol α is used for FGW balance (Section 3.2), spectral mixing (Section 3.3), and label interpolation (Section 3.4), and Appendix A.3 lists “Alpha” as a tuned parameter without disambiguation, hindering reproducibility (Appendix A.3).\n- **Evaluation scope and fairness details are under-specified**\n  - Table 4 reports “mean ± var” without stating number of runs/seeds or significance tests (Section 4.2), limiting statistical confidence in comparative claims.\n  - Hyperparameter tuning is detailed for SPECTRA (Appendix A.3) but baseline tuning protocols are not described; it is unclear whether baselines received comparable search budgets, impacting fairness.\n  - Train/validation/test split strategies and potential scaffold splits are not specified (Appendix A.1, A.3), which affects generalization assessment and comparability across runs. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.\n- **Coverage and correlation analyses rely on qualitative visuals without quantitative metrics**\n  - t-SNE plots of Morgan fingerprints (Figure 3; Section 4.1) illustrate coverage but lack quantitative measures (e.g., distribution distances or coverage scores), weakening the evidence of broader chemical space coverage.\n  - Property–target joint plots (Figure 3) are used to assert trend preservation, but no correlation coefficients or regression analyses are provided; claims remain qualitative (Section 4.1).\n  - The per-range MAE (Figure 4) is visual; numerical summaries or statistical tests (e.g., confidence intervals) are absent, limiting rigor of rare-region improvement claims.\n- **Rarity-aware budgeting lacks specification and sensitivity analysis**\n  - KDE bandwidth choice is not reported in Section 3.5 (Figure 1 uses Scott’s rule-of-thumb for illustration), and there is no sensitivity study on bandwidth’s impact on rarity weights, affecting robustness.\n  - The augmentation rate “perc” and total budget “N” (Section 3.5) are not instantiated in experiments (Appendix A.3 does not list perc), limiting reproducibility.\n  - Pair selection by |y_i − y_j| (Section 3.5) may bias to near-neighbors and risk limited diversity; no mechanism is described to avoid repeated augmentation of similar scaffolds or to ensure coverage of structurally diverse pairs.\n- **Generality and comparisons are limited**\n  - Datasets are relatively small to medium (Appendix A.1; Table 5: ESOL 1,128; FreeSolv 642; Lipo 4,200), and there is no evaluation on larger or more complex datasets, limiting external validity.\n  - 3D features and multi-property settings are noted as future work (Section 5) but not demonstrated; the current approach uses 2D graphs with limited geometric constraints (Section 3.1).\n  - Although spectral augmentation is discussed in related work (Section 2.2; Yang et al., 2024), the experimental baselines do not include a spectral augmentation method, limiting novelty positioning via direct comparison.Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Strengthen guarantees and empirical validation of reconstruction and label interpolation**\n  - Provide theoretical analysis or constraints ensuring that W_α reconstruction (Section 3.4) preserves graph simplicity and chemically valid bond configurations; for instance, enforce valence-aware edge pruning and demonstrate with failure cases from RDKit sanitization.\n  - Augment validity assessment (Section 3.6; Table 1) with qualitative/quantitative error analysis (e.g., reasons for any failures if present), and include checks of aromaticity/valence consistency pre- and post-sanitization to bolster trust.\n  - Justify or evaluate label interpolation (Section 3.4) by computing correlations of y_α with computed properties or running property prediction baselines on synthetic molecules to verify physical plausibility; report results alongside Figure 3.\n  - Specify and evaluate the discretization/thresholding used to convert continuous per-channel edge weights into discrete bond type/stereochemistry/conjugation (Sections 3.4–3.6), including any calibration to RDKit rules.\n- **Clarify spectral interpolation choices and multi-channel integration**\n  - Specify eigenvector set size k, ordering strategy, and handling of near-eigenvalue multiplicities (Section 3.3), including sensitivity experiments to sign/ordering ambiguities and their effect on reconstruction.\n  - Detail how the three edge-specific adjacencies are combined for convolution (Section 3.7)—e.g., channel-wise ChebConv with learned weights or concatenation—so others can reproduce the edge-aware mechanism.\n  - Report augmentation-time breakdown (eigendecomposition per channel/pair) vs training-time costs, and include numerical stability diagnostics (e.g., condition numbers, orthogonality checks) to substantiate efficiency claims beyond Figure 5.\n  - Disambiguate the different roles of α (FGW balance vs spectral mixing vs label interpolation) and state which α is tuned in Appendix A.3; provide fixed values or ranges for the others (Sections 3.2–3.4; Appendix A.3).\n- **Improve evaluation rigor and fairness**\n  - State the number of runs/seeds for Table 4, switch “var” to standard deviation, and add statistical tests (e.g., paired t-test or bootstrap) to support claims of improvements (Section 4.2).\n  - Describe baseline hyperparameter search spaces/protocols to ensure comparable tuning (Appendix A.3), or cite canonical configs when applicable; include ablations showing SPECTRA robustness under reduced tuning budgets.\n  - Clarify split strategies (random/scaffold/time-split) and report metrics by split to assess generalization; if scaffold splits are used, note whether augmented molecules respect split boundaries (Appendix A.1, A.3).\n- **Add quantitative coverage and correlation metrics**\n  - Complement t-SNE visuals (Figure 3) with quantitative measures such as coverage ratios over binning of fingerprints, KL divergence between original and augmented molecular property distributions, or nearest-neighbor diversity indices (Section 4.1).\n  - Compute correlation coefficients (Pearson/Spearman) or simple regressions for property–target relationships for both original and augmented sets and report shifts to substantiate “trend preservation” (Figure 3).\n  - Provide numerical per-range MAE tables with confidence intervals for Figure 4 and test for significance of rare-range improvements to strengthen RQ3 claims.\n- **Specify and test rarity-aware budgeting choices**\n  - Report the KDE bandwidth used in Section 3.5 and conduct sensitivity analysis over multiple bandwidths (including Scott’s rule-of-thumb noted in Figure 1) to show robustness of rarity weights.\n  - Explicitly state augmentation rate “perc” and total budget “N” used in experiments (Appendix A.3), and evaluate performance as these parameters vary to guide practitioners.\n  - Introduce diversity-aware pair selection (e.g., structural dissimilarity thresholds, scaffold-aware pairing) to avoid overfitting to local neighborhoods; measure its effect on uniqueness/novelty (Table 1–2).\n- **Broaden generality and comparative baselines**\n  - Evaluate on larger datasets (e.g., other MoleculeNet tasks) or industrial-scale collections to test scalability beyond Table 5 sizes (Appendix A.1), and report runtime scaling curves alongside Figure 5.\n  - Incorporate 3D geometric features (e.g., coordinates or distance matrices) into Laplacian channels (Section 3.1) and test their effect, aligning with the stated future direction (Section 5).\n  - Add baselines that reflect spectral augmentation or imbalanced regression strategies referenced in Section 2.2 (e.g., Yang et al., 2024) to position SPECTRA’s novelty via direct comparison.Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Competitive performance with clear geometric augmentation (Figure 2; Table 4; Figure 4) and strong validity/efficiency evidence (Table 1; Figure 5), tempered by missing guarantees and evaluation details (Sections 3.4, 3.6; Appendix A.3).\n- Novelty (10): 7 — Combining FGW alignment, spectral interpolation, and KDE-based rarity budgeting (Sections 3.2–3.5; Section 2.5) is distinctive, though direct comparisons to related spectral augmentation work are absent (Section 2.2).\n- Technical Quality (10): 6 — Method is well-motivated with ablations (Table 6) and stable alignment steps (Section 3.3), but lacks theoretical guarantees for reconstruction/label interpolation and detailed complexity analyses (Sections 3.4, 3.6; Figure 5).\n- Clarity (10): 7 — The pipeline and experiments are generally clear (Figure 2; Sections 3.1–3.7; Tables 1–4), yet key implementation/evaluation specifics (baseline tuning, splits, augmentation parameters) are under-specified (Appendix A.3; Section 4.2).\n- Confidence (5): 4 — The assessment is based on the manuscript’s figures/tables and appendices (Figures 2–5; Tables 1–6), but some missing details and lack of statistical tests limit certainty."
