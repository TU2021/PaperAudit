          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the novelty of the training-free Cross-model Retrieval (CMR) strategy, its practicality, and the strong empirical speedups for long sequences. The alignment is very high, with both emphasizing that the paper successfully addresses a critical problem in speculative decoding.",
          "weakness": "There is partial overlap, with both reviews critiquing the unfair baseline comparisons and the reliance on last-layer attention without sufficient justification. However, Review B identifies a major weakness completely missed by Review A: the lack of end-task quality metrics (e.g., ROUGE, accuracy) to validate the speedups.",
          "overall": "The reviews align very well on the paper's strengths and core contribution, but diverge significantly on the weaknesses, as the AI review raises a critical concern about missing task-quality metrics that the human review overlooks. This leads to a moderate overall alignment, where the general positive judgment is similar but the key reservations differ in focus and importance."

          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned in their positive assessment of the paper's core contribution and empirical results. However, they diverge on the evaluation of its flaws, as Review B provides a more comprehensive critique that includes the crucial missing point of quality assessment, leading to a less consistent overall judgment on the paper's rigor."
