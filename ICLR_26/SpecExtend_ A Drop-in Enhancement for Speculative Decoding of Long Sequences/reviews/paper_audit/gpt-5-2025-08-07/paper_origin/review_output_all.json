  "baseline_review": "Summary\n- The paper addresses the early, moderate-length performance degradation of speculative decoding in large language models. It proposes SpecExtend, a training-free, drop-in enhancement composed of two parts: efficient attention mechanisms (FlashAttention in prefill and Hybrid Tree Attention in verification; Section 3.1, Figure 1) and Cross-model Retrieval (CMR), a KV-cache eviction strategy that uses the target model’s attention scores to select and retain globally relevant chunks in the draft model’s cache (Section 3.2.1, Algorithm 1). A speedup analysis (Equation 1; Section 3.2.2) motivates the need to reduce draft latency and maintain high draft acceptance length τ. Experiments on long summarization (GovReport, PG-19, BookSum) and long reasoning (AIME-24) show speedups up to 2.84× and 3.86×, respectively (Table 2, Figure 5, Figure 6), with small overhead from retrieving attention scores (Table 8). Ablations isolate contributions of CMR, FlashAttention, and Hybrid Tree Attention (Table 4), and parameter studies for CMR are provided (Table 5).Strengths\n- Bolded title: Clear identification of the underexplored moderate-length degradation regime\n  - Evidence: Figure 2 explicitly shows that “performance significantly declines well before the shift of memory bottleneck,” anchoring the problem and motivating a solution targeted at the moderate-length regime (Section: Experiments).\n  - Why it matters: Establishes a concrete and under-characterized failure mode, which gives the contribution clear relevance and impact.\n  - Evidence: Introduction highlights two causes—quadratic attention latency and reduced draft accuracy—at moderate lengths (Section 1).\n  - Why it matters: Provides a grounded diagnosis that frames the chosen interventions (efficient attention and retrieval), strengthening technical soundness.\n  - Evidence: Theoretical speedup framing (Equation 1; Section 3.2.2) connects τ and latencies to end-to-end speed, justifying focus on both draft speed and accuracy.\n  - Why it matters: The analysis ensures the method targets the right variables for improving speed without retraining.- Bolded title: Novel, training-free Cross-model Retrieval for KV cache management\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.1 and Algorithm 1 describe chunking the prefix, ranking by target attention from the last accepted token, and retaining top-k chunks for the draft cache.\n  - Why it matters: Provides a technical mechanism to reduce draft KV cache while preserving globally relevant context, improving both speed and τ without retraining.\n  - Evidence: Table 1 (Needle Retrieval) shows large accuracy gains for “needle” tokens (0.823 with CMR vs 0.166 with StreamingLLM; Vicuna-7B/160M setup).\n  - Why it matters: Demonstrates that the smaller draft model can leverage target-guided retrieval effectively, addressing the concern that only the large model benefits from retrieval.\n  - Evidence: Figure 3 shows improved acceptance rates for both hard and easy tokens and lower natural divergence across positions.\n  - Why it matters: Indicates broad draft–target alignment improvements, not limited to edge cases.- Bolded title: Drop-in integration of efficient attention for prefill and verification\n  - Evidence: Section 3.1 applies FlashAttention to prefill for both target and draft models and Hybrid Tree Attention (HTA) to verification; Figure 1 depicts the integration.\n  - Why it matters: Reduces latency where quadratic attention dominates, addressing prefill and verification bottlenecks in long sequences without changing model outputs.\n  - Evidence: Table 4 ablation shows FlashAttention yields up to 1.25× speedup on 16K and HTA yields up to 1.19× speedup beyond 8K.\n  - Why it matters: Confirms each component’s standalone impact and supports the combined design choice.- Bolded title: Strong, comprehensive empirical results across tasks, models, and lengths\n  - Evidence: Table 2 and Figure 5 report speedups across GovReport/PG-19/BookSum for multiple setups (Vicuna-7B/LongChat-7B targets; Vicuna-68M/EAGLE drafts) up to 16K tokens, with consistent gains (e.g., 2.81× on BookSum 16K).\n  - Why it matters: Demonstrates robustness and generality across datasets and frameworks, increasing practical significance.\n  - Evidence: Figure 6 shows long reasoning speedup (AIME-24), 117.21 Tok/s with EAGLE-3 + SpecExtend vs 30.34 Tok/s with EAGLE-3, and τ increase from 1.89 to 5.95.\n  - Why it matters: Highlights performance on a distinct generation pattern (short prompt, very long output), supporting claims of broad applicability.\n  - Evidence: Table 6 (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with EAGLE/EAGLE-3) and Table 7 (PG-19 up to 128K tokens) show integration with newer frameworks and very long contexts.\n  - Why it matters: Shows compatibility and effectiveness beyond the initial setups, including extremely long inputs.- Bolded title: Evidence of low overhead and practical implementation choices\n  - Evidence: Table 8 shows the retrieval cache update adds 0.34 ms and target forward with retrieval adds ~0.35 ms, indicating minimal overhead on 16K inputs.\n  - Why it matters: Supports practicality of CMR in real deployments.\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.1 explains extracting final-layer attention scores only during verification to avoid full matrix materialization with FlashDecoding.\n  - Why it matters: Demonstrates careful integration with optimized kernels, preserving speed while enabling retrieval.\n  - Evidence: Figure 4b provides an end-to-end latency breakdown showing reductions across target prefill, verification, and drafting stages.\n  - Why it matters: Offers transparency on where gains occur, aiding reproducibility and adoption.- Bolded title: Ablation of retrieval parameters and component contributions\n  - Evidence: Table 5 systematically explores working cache size, chunk size, top-k, retrieval frequency for Vicuna-68M/EAGLE drafts on 8K GovReport.\n  - Why it matters: Guides practitioners in tuning CMR to their setups, increasing usability.\n  - Evidence: Table 4 isolates contributions of CMR vs StreamingLLM, FlashAttention, and HTA across input lengths.\n  - Why it matters: Strengthens the argument that CMR is the primary driver of gains in the moderate-length regime, clarifying novelty.- Bolded title: Clear problem framing and compatibility claims\n  - Evidence: Introduction and Related Work (Sections 1–2) clearly position SpecExtend relative to TriForce, MagicDec, LongSpec, and EAGLE variants, emphasizing training-free drop-in use.\n  - Why it matters: Helps the reader situate the contribution within the ecosystem and understand intended use-cases.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.2 (Table 3) shows comparisons where SpecExtend-enhanced standard speculative decoding outperforms FlashDecoding, TriForce, and MagicDec in the reported settings.\n  - Why it matters: Indicates competitive performance among practical alternatives without additional training.\n  - Evidence: Appendix A.2 details hardware, sampling protocol (20 inputs per length, two runs), and dynamic tree settings.\n  - Why it matters: Adds reproducibility detail and transparency for experimental procedure.Weaknesses\n- Bolded title: Limited evaluation of output quality and correctness beyond speed\n  - Evidence: Long summarization reports only τ, tokens/s, speedup (Table 2; Figure 5) and no ROUGE/BERTScore or human evaluation; no side-by-side quality assessment under SpecExtend.\n  - Why it matters: Without quality metrics, it is unclear if speed improvements preserve summarization fidelity in practice despite theoretical “lossless” decoding.\n  - Evidence: Long reasoning results on AIME-24 report tokens/s and τ (Figure 6) but not accuracy/pass@1; Section 4.1.2 focuses on speedup, not correctness.\n  - Why it matters: For reasoning, correctness is crucial; lack of accuracy reporting weakens claims about practical utility.\n  - Evidence: The paper asserts lossless properties via speculative decoding (Section 2) but does not empirically verify that outputs match standard decoding under identical seeds/settings across tasks.\n  - Why it matters: Empirical validation of distribution preservation is important, particularly when verification is modified (HTA) and retrieval uses final-layer attention.- Bolded title: Incomplete methodological specification for CMR and attention integration\n  - Evidence: Algorithm 1 includes SELECTCHUNKS and UPDATEDRAFTCACHE without detailing how chunk ranking aggregates multi-head/multi-layer attention or resolves overlaps (Section 3.2.1).\n  - Why it matters: Insufficient detail may hinder implementation fidelity and reproducibility, affecting technical clarity.\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.1 uses only final-layer attention scores due to FlashDecoding constraints; while latency overhead (Table 8) is reported, there is no analysis supporting final-layer sufficiency across tasks.\n  - Why it matters: Choice of final-layer attention may affect retrieval quality; methodological justification is needed.\n  - Evidence: The text mentions retrieval “can be applied adaptively or less frequently” (Section 3.2.1) without specifying an adaptive policy or trigger.\n  - Why it matters: Missing policy description limits understanding of how to systematically balance overhead and accuracy.- Bolded title: Generality and hardware limitations in evaluation\n  - Evidence: All experiments are on a single A100 80GB GPU (Section 4, Appendix A.2); there is no cross-hardware evaluation (e.g., consumer GPUs or multi-GPU).\n  - Why it matters: Performance and feasibility may vary across hardware; generality claims would be stronger with broader evaluation.\n  - Evidence: The method depends on extracting attention scores during verification; FlashDecoding avoids full matrices (Section 3.2.1), requiring a fallback that may not exist or be efficient in all runtimes.\n  - Why it matters: Practical deployability in different serving stacks might be constrained; compatibility should be empirically demonstrated.\n  - Evidence: Base models in experiments are 7B–8B (Vicuna/LongChat/Llama-3.1; Table 2, Table 6); there is no evaluation for larger targets (e.g., ≥30B or 70B).\n  - Why it matters: SpecExtend’s benefits and overheads could differ at larger scales; claims of broad compatibility would benefit from such evidence.- Bolded title: Limited theoretical novelty and depth beyond restating prior speedup formula\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.2 restates Equation 1 from prior work and argues qualitatively that CMR reduces Td and maintains τ; no new formal derivations or bounds are provided.\n  - Why it matters: Theoretical contribution is modest; deeper analysis would strengthen technical rigor.\n  - Evidence: No analytical model quantifies trade-off between retrieval overhead (Table 8) and speedup or the relationship between cache size and τ beyond empirical plots/tables.\n  - Why it matters: Without formalization, generalizability of the speed–accuracy trade-off is unclear.\n  - Evidence: The interplay of chunk size/top-k/retrieval frequency on τ and acceptance distributions is studied empirically (Table 5) but lacks theoretical characterization.\n  - Why it matters: A theoretical perspective could guide parameter selection for unseen settings.- Bolded title: Baseline coverage and fairness concerns\n  - Evidence: Section 4.2 (Table 3) compares FlashDecoding, TriForce, MagicDec, and Standard; however, details of optimization/hyperparameters for these baselines are not provided.\n  - Why it matters: Under-optimized baselines can skew comparisons; transparency is required for fairness.\n  - Evidence: LongSpec is excluded due to training requirements (Section 2, Section 4.2), but the paper’s contribution competes with such methods in practice; no reference metrics are provided.\n  - Why it matters: Readers cannot contextualize trade-offs vs training-based approaches; comparative positioning is incomplete.\n  - Evidence: Cache eviction baselines are limited primarily to StreamingLLM; other variants or heuristics (e.g., alternative windowing policies) are not reported. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.\n  - Why it matters: Establishing that CMR outperforms a wider set of non-training baselines would strengthen claims.- Bolded title: Clarity on datasets, evaluation protocols, and reproducibility\n  - Evidence: Appendix A.2 mentions sampling 20 inputs per length and running twice, but does not describe pre-processing details (e.g., truncation/splitting strategies) for long summarization.\n  - Why it matters: Subtle data handling choices can affect latency and τ; replication requires more detail.\n  - Evidence: The definition and calculation of “average accepted length” τ in tree-based speculative decoding are not fully specified (Section 4, Table 2; Figure 4a uses τ comparisons across cache settings).\n  - Why it matters: Different tree policies can affect counting; clarity is needed for consistent measurement.\n  - Evidence: The entropy-based “hard/easy token” categorization (Figure 3) lacks a precise formula and whether entropy is computed from the draft or target distributions.\n  - Why it matters: Reproducing the accuracy/divergence analysis requires these details; technical clarity would improve.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Bolded title: Add comprehensive output quality evaluations alongside speed\n  - Recommendation: For long summarization, report ROUGE/BERTScore and, if feasible, human ratings, comparing Standard vs SpecExtend across input lengths (Table 2; Figure 5) to validate that speedups preserve quality.\n  - Recommendation: For long reasoning (AIME-24), include pass@1 or accuracy metrics with identical generation settings (Figure 6; Section 4.1.2) to demonstrate correctness retention under SpecExtend.\n  - Recommendation: Empirically validate “lossless” behavior by checking bitwise equivalence (or distributional equivalence under fixed seeds) between Standard and SpecExtend outputs on held-out inputs, especially when HTA is enabled (Section 3.1) and final-layer attention is used for retrieval (Section 3.2.1).- Bolded title: Provide fuller methodological detail for CMR and attention extraction\n  - Recommendation: Specify how SELECTCHUNKS aggregates attention over heads/layers, handles overlapping chunks, and updates cache indices (Algorithm 1; Section 3.2.1) to ensure reproducible implementations.\n  - Recommendation: Justify the use of final-layer attention with a small study comparing retrieval using different layers/aggregations, reporting its effect on τ and divergence (Table 8 for overhead; Section 3.2.1).\n  - Recommendation: Define and evaluate an adaptive retrieval policy (e.g., based on acceptance rate drops or entropy spikes; Figure 3) to operationalize “applied adaptively or less frequently” (Section 3.2.1).- Bolded title: Strengthen generality claims with broader hardware and scale evaluations\n  - Recommendation: Report results on varied hardware (e.g., A6000/A5000 or H100, and multi-GPU inference) to demonstrate practicality beyond a single A100 80GB (Section 4; Appendix A.2).\n  - Recommendation: Evaluate compatibility in different serving stacks where attention scores may not be readily available from optimized kernels; measure overhead of the fallback (Section 3.2.1) across runtimes.\n  - Recommendation: Include experiments with larger targets (e.g., ≥30B/70B) and different draft ratios to assess how SpecExtend scales (Table 2, Table 6) and whether overheads remain minimal (Table 8).- Bolded title: Deepen theoretical analysis beyond prior speedup formula\n  - Recommendation: Develop a simple analytical model linking working cache size, chunk size, top-k, and retrieval frequency (Table 5) to expected τ and Td, yielding guidance for parameter selection.\n  - Recommendation: Quantify the trade-off between retrieval overhead (Table 8) and τ improvement in closed form or via asymptotic bounds, and validate with measured breakdowns (Figure 4b).\n  - Recommendation: Provide a bound or probabilistic analysis on how target-guided retrieval affects divergence (Figure 3) and acceptance rates, possibly under assumptions about attention concentration.- Bolded title: Expand and document baseline configurations for fairness\n  - Recommendation: Detail hyperparameters and optimization settings for TriForce, MagicDec, and FlashDecoding (Section 4.2; Table 3), and consider consulting authors’ recommended configs to avoid under-optimization.\n  - Recommendation: Include reference comparisons to LongSpec (Section 2), even if training-based, documenting the training cost vs runtime benefit trade-off to situate SpecExtend.\n  - Recommendation: Add more non-training eviction baselines beyond StreamingLLM (e.g., fixed sliding window or heuristic relevance scoring), and compare their τ/tokens/s to CMR on the same datasets and lengths.- Bolded title: Improve clarity of datasets, metrics, and analysis reproducibility\n  - Recommendation: Precisely describe preprocessing (tokenization, truncation, segmentation) for GovReport/PG-19/BookSum inputs at each length, and publish input IDs used per run (Appendix A.2).\n  - Recommendation: Define τ calculation for tree-based speculative decoding (e.g., per target step average accepted tokens across branches) and ensure consistency across frameworks (Table 2; Figure 4a).\n  - Recommendation: Formalize the entropy computation (draft vs target distribution, window size) and the natural divergence formula used (Figure 3), and include code snippets or equations to enable reproduction.Score\n- Overall (10): 7 — Strong empirical gains across tasks and frameworks (Table 2, Figure 5, Figure 6) with a clear, training-free method (Section 3.2.1), but limited output quality evaluation and theoretical depth (Section 4.1.1; Section 3.2.2).\n- Novelty (10): 7 — Cross-model Retrieval for draft KV eviction guided by target attention (Section 3.2.1; Algorithm 1; Table 1) is a fresh, practical idea; efficient attention integration is known (Section 3.1; Table 4).\n- Technical Quality (10): 7 — Solid engineering and thorough ablations (Table 4, Table 5; Table 8) and extensive benchmarks (Table 2, Table 3, Table 6, Table 7), but missing quality metrics and formal analysis (Figure 6; Section 3.2.2).\n- Clarity (10): 7 — Clear motivation and presentation (Figure 1; Section 1; Section 3.1–3.2), with some methodological gaps in CMR specifics and analysis definitions (Algorithm 1; Figure 3; Appendix A.2).\n- Confidence (5): 4 — High confidence based on detailed experiments and ablations (Table 2, Table 4, Table 5), though lacking quality metrics and some methodological details tempers certainty (Section 4.1.1; Section 3.2.1).",

technical clarity would improve.\n- Bolded title: Internal consistency issues in speedup definitions, baselines, and reporting\n  - Evidence: Equation 1 in Section 3.2.2 labels T_avg^sd/T_t as “speedup,” while this quantity is a normalized latency ratio; additionally, the variable d appears but is not defined in the surrounding text, whereas K is used for block size in Algorithm 1 (Section 3.2.1).\n  - Why it matters: Terminology and notation ambiguities in the core analysis hinder interpretability and correct reasoning about improvements.\n  - Evidence: Table 2’s caption states speedup is measured relative to naive autoregressive generation; Figure 5 presents “speedup comparison” and its values match Table 2; the Abstract and Section 4.4.1 also state “up to 2.84×” and “2.84× speedup over the standard setting,” respectively.\n  - Why it matters: Mixing baselines (vs AR vs standard speculative decoding) across text, tables, and figures can mislead comparisons and complicate assessing practical gains.\n  - Evidence: Table 2 reports identical tokens/s across distinct target configurations at several lengths (e.g., GovReport 1K “No”: 100.31 Tok/s for both Vicuna-7B/Vicuna-68M and LongChat-7B/LongChat-68M; GovReport 16K “No”: 16.56 Tok/s for both, while speedups differ at 16K: 1.38× vs 1.51×).\n  - Why it matters: Apparent reporting inconsistencies reduce confidence in comparative results and make verification difficult.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.1.2 (Decoding) states “even falling below EAGLE-1 (Table 6),” but Table 6 contains results for EAGLE and EAGLE-3 only.\n  - Why it matters: Unsupported claims weaken credibility and should be aligned with available evidence.\n  - Evidence: Appendix A.2 refers to “parameters described in Section 5,” but Section 5 is the Conclusion; retrieval parameter details appear in Section 4.3.2 (Table 5).\n  - Why it matters: Misreferences impede reproducibility by sending readers to the wrong section.\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.1 states attention scores are obtained with “no additional forward passes,” yet also notes computing standard attention to extract final-layer scores due to FlashDecoding; Table 8 shows a small “Target Forward w/ Retrieval” overhead.\n  - Why it matters: Ambiguity about computation changes in verification may lead to misunderstandings about overhead and implementation requirements.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Bolded title: Add comprehensive output quality evaluations alongside speed\n  - Recommendation: For long summarization, report ROUGE/BERTScore and, if feasible, human ratings, comparing Standard vs SpecExtend across input lengths (Table 2;

  "reviews": "Summary\n- The paper addresses the early, moderate-length performance degradation of speculative decoding in large language models. It proposes SpecExtend, a training-free, drop-in enhancement composed of two parts: efficient attention mechanisms (FlashAttention in prefill and Hybrid Tree Attention in verification; Section 3.1, Figure 1) and Cross-model Retrieval (CMR), a KV-cache eviction strategy that uses the target model’s attention scores to select and retain globally relevant chunks in the draft model’s cache (Section 3.2.1, Algorithm 1). A speedup analysis (Equation 1; Section 3.2.2) motivates the need to reduce draft latency and maintain high draft acceptance length τ. Experiments on long summarization (GovReport, PG-19, BookSum) and long reasoning (AIME-24) show speedups up to 2.84× and 3.86×, respectively (Table 2, Figure 5, Figure 6), with small overhead from retrieving attention scores (Table 8). Ablations isolate contributions of CMR, FlashAttention, and Hybrid Tree Attention (Table 4), and parameter studies for CMR are provided (Table 5).Strengths\n- Bolded title: Clear identification of the underexplored moderate-length degradation regime\n  - Evidence: Figure 2 explicitly shows that “performance significantly declines well before the shift of memory bottleneck,” anchoring the problem and motivating a solution targeted at the moderate-length regime (Section: Experiments).\n  - Why it matters: Establishes a concrete and under-characterized failure mode, which gives the contribution clear relevance and impact.\n  - Evidence: Introduction highlights two causes—quadratic attention latency and reduced draft accuracy—at moderate lengths (Section 1).\n  - Why it matters: Provides a grounded diagnosis that frames the chosen interventions (efficient attention and retrieval), strengthening technical soundness.\n  - Evidence: Theoretical speedup framing (Equation 1; Section 3.2.2) connects τ and latencies to end-to-end speed, justifying focus on both draft speed and accuracy.\n  - Why it matters: The analysis ensures the method targets the right variables for improving speed without retraining.\n- Bolded title: Novel, training-free Cross-model Retrieval for KV cache management\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.1 and Algorithm 1 describe chunking the prefix, ranking by target attention from the last accepted token, and retaining top-k chunks for the draft cache.\n  - Why it matters: Provides a technical mechanism to reduce draft KV cache while preserving globally relevant context, improving both speed and τ without retraining.\n  - Evidence: Table 1 (Needle Retrieval) shows large accuracy gains for “needle” tokens (0.823 with CMR vs 0.166 with StreamingLLM; Vicuna-7B/160M setup).\n  - Why it matters: Demonstrates that the smaller draft model can leverage target-guided retrieval effectively, addressing the concern that only the large model benefits from retrieval.\n  - Evidence: Figure 3 shows improved acceptance rates for both hard and easy tokens and lower natural divergence across positions.\n  - Why it matters: Indicates broad draft–target alignment improvements, not limited to edge cases.\n- Bolded title: Drop-in integration of efficient attention for prefill and verification\n  - Evidence: Section 3.1 applies FlashAttention to prefill for both target and draft models and Hybrid Tree Attention (HTA) to verification; Figure 1 depicts the integration.\n  - Why it matters: Reduces latency where quadratic attention dominates, addressing prefill and verification bottlenecks in long sequences without changing model outputs.\n  - Evidence: Table 4 ablation shows FlashAttention yields up to 1.25× speedup on 16K and HTA yields up to 1.19× speedup beyond 8K.\n  - Why it matters: Confirms each component’s standalone impact and supports the combined design choice.\n- Bolded title: Strong, comprehensive empirical results across tasks, models, and lengths\n  - Evidence: Table 2 and Figure 5 report speedups across GovReport/PG-19/BookSum for multiple setups (Vicuna-7B/LongChat-7B targets; Vicuna-68M/EAGLE drafts) up to 16K tokens, with consistent gains (e.g., 2.81× on BookSum 16K).\n  - Why it matters: Demonstrates robustness and generality across datasets and frameworks, increasing practical significance.\n  - Evidence: Figure 6 shows long reasoning speedup (AIME-24), 117.21 Tok/s with EAGLE-3 + SpecExtend vs 30.34 Tok/s with EAGLE-3, and τ increase from 1.89 to 5.95.\n  - Why it matters: Highlights performance on a distinct generation pattern (short prompt, very long output), supporting claims of broad applicability.\n  - Evidence: Table 6 (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with EAGLE/EAGLE-3) and Table 7 (PG-19 up to 128K tokens) show integration with newer frameworks and very long contexts.\n  - Why it matters: Shows compatibility and effectiveness beyond the initial setups, including extremely long inputs.\n- Bolded title: Evidence of low overhead and practical implementation choices\n  - Evidence: Table 8 shows the retrieval cache update adds 0.34 ms and target forward with retrieval adds ~0.35 ms, indicating minimal overhead on 16K inputs.\n  - Why it matters: Supports practicality of CMR in real deployments.\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.1 explains extracting final-layer attention scores only during verification to avoid full matrix materialization with FlashDecoding.\n  - Why it matters: Demonstrates careful integration with optimized kernels, preserving speed while enabling retrieval.\n  - Evidence: Figure 4b provides an end-to-end latency breakdown showing reductions across target prefill, verification, and drafting stages.\n  - Why it matters: Offers transparency on where gains occur, aiding reproducibility and adoption.\n- Bolded title: Ablation of retrieval parameters and component contributions\n  - Evidence: Table 5 systematically explores working cache size, chunk size, top-k, retrieval frequency for Vicuna-68M/EAGLE drafts on 8K GovReport.\n  - Why it matters: Guides practitioners in tuning CMR to their setups, increasing usability.\n  - Evidence: Table 4 isolates contributions of CMR vs StreamingLLM, FlashAttention, and HTA across input lengths.\n  - Why it matters: Strengthens the argument that CMR is the primary driver of gains in the moderate-length regime, clarifying novelty.\n- Bolded title: Clear problem framing and compatibility claims\n  - Evidence: Introduction and Related Work (Sections 1–2) clearly position SpecExtend relative to TriForce, MagicDec, LongSpec, and EAGLE variants, emphasizing training-free drop-in use.\n  - Why it matters: Helps the reader situate the contribution within the ecosystem and understand intended use-cases.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.2 (Table 3) shows comparisons where SpecExtend-enhanced standard speculative decoding outperforms FlashDecoding, TriForce, and MagicDec in the reported settings.\n  - Why it matters: Indicates competitive performance among practical alternatives without additional training.\n  - Evidence: Appendix A.2 details hardware, sampling protocol (20 inputs per length, two runs), and dynamic tree settings.\n  - Why it matters: Adds reproducibility detail and transparency for experimental procedure.Weaknesses\n- Bolded title: Limited evaluation of output quality and correctness beyond speed\n  - Evidence: Long summarization reports only τ, tokens/s, speedup (Table 2; Figure 5) and no ROUGE/BERTScore or human evaluation; no side-by-side quality assessment under SpecExtend.\n  - Why it matters: Without quality metrics, it is unclear if speed improvements preserve summarization fidelity in practice despite theoretical “lossless” decoding.\n  - Evidence: Long reasoning results on AIME-24 report tokens/s and τ (Figure 6) but not accuracy/pass@1; Section 4.1.2 focuses on speedup, not correctness.\n  - Why it matters: For reasoning, correctness is crucial; lack of accuracy reporting weakens claims about practical utility.\n  - Evidence: The paper asserts lossless properties via speculative decoding (Section 2) but does not empirically verify that outputs match standard decoding under identical seeds/settings across tasks.\n  - Why it matters: Empirical validation of distribution preservation is important, particularly when verification is modified (HTA) and retrieval uses final-layer attention.\n- Bolded title: Incomplete methodological specification for CMR and attention integration\n  - Evidence: Algorithm 1 includes SELECTCHUNKS and UPDATEDRAFTCACHE without detailing how chunk ranking aggregates multi-head/multi-layer attention or resolves overlaps (Section 3.2.1).\n  - Why it matters: Insufficient detail may hinder implementation fidelity and reproducibility, affecting technical clarity.\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.1 uses only final-layer attention scores due to FlashDecoding constraints; while latency overhead (Table 8) is reported, there is no analysis supporting final-layer sufficiency across tasks.\n  - Why it matters: Choice of final-layer attention may affect retrieval quality; methodological justification is needed.\n  - Evidence: The text mentions retrieval “can be applied adaptively or less frequently” (Section 3.2.1) without specifying an adaptive policy or trigger.\n  - Why it matters: Missing policy description limits understanding of how to systematically balance overhead and accuracy.\n- Bolded title: Generality and hardware limitations in evaluation\n  - Evidence: All experiments are on a single A100 80GB GPU (Section 4, Appendix A.2); there is no cross-hardware evaluation (e.g., consumer GPUs or multi-GPU).\n  - Why it matters: Performance and feasibility may vary across hardware; generality claims would be stronger with broader evaluation.\n  - Evidence: The method depends on extracting attention scores during verification; FlashDecoding avoids full matrices (Section 3.2.1), requiring a fallback that may not exist or be efficient in all runtimes.\n  - Why it matters: Practical deployability in different serving stacks might be constrained; compatibility should be empirically demonstrated.\n  - Evidence: Base models in experiments are 7B–8B (Vicuna/LongChat/Llama-3.1; Table 2, Table 6); there is no evaluation for larger targets (e.g., ≥30B or 70B).\n  - Why it matters: SpecExtend’s benefits and overheads could differ at larger scales; claims of broad compatibility would benefit from such evidence.\n- Bolded title: Limited theoretical novelty and depth beyond restating prior speedup formula\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.2 restates Equation 1 from prior work and argues qualitatively that CMR reduces Td and maintains τ; no new formal derivations or bounds are provided.\n  - Why it matters: Theoretical contribution is modest; deeper analysis would strengthen technical rigor.\n  - Evidence: No analytical model quantifies trade-off between retrieval overhead (Table 8) and speedup or the relationship between cache size and τ beyond empirical plots/tables.\n  - Why it matters: Without formalization, generalizability of the speed–accuracy trade-off is unclear.\n  - Evidence: The interplay of chunk size/top-k/retrieval frequency on τ and acceptance distributions is studied empirically (Table 5) but lacks theoretical characterization.\n  - Why it matters: A theoretical perspective could guide parameter selection for unseen settings.\n- Bolded title: Baseline coverage and fairness concerns\n  - Evidence: Section 4.2 (Table 3) compares FlashDecoding, TriForce, MagicDec, and Standard; however, details of optimization/hyperparameters for these baselines are not provided.\n  - Why it matters: Under-optimized baselines can skew comparisons; transparency is required for fairness.\n  - Evidence: LongSpec is excluded due to training requirements (Section 2, Section 4.2), but the paper’s contribution competes with such methods in practice; no reference metrics are provided.\n  - Why it matters: Readers cannot contextualize trade-offs vs training-based approaches; comparative positioning is incomplete.\n  - Evidence: Cache eviction baselines are limited primarily to StreamingLLM; other variants or heuristics (e.g., alternative windowing policies) are not reported. No direct evidence found in the manuscript.\n  - Why it matters: Establishing that CMR outperforms a wider set of non-training baselines would strengthen claims.\n- Bolded title: Clarity on datasets, evaluation protocols, and reproducibility\n  - Evidence: Appendix A.2 mentions sampling 20 inputs per length and running twice, but does not describe pre-processing details (e.g., truncation/splitting strategies) for long summarization.\n  - Why it matters: Subtle data handling choices can affect latency and τ; replication requires more detail.\n  - Evidence: The definition and calculation of “average accepted length” τ in tree-based speculative decoding are not fully specified (Section 4, Table 2; Figure 4a uses τ comparisons across cache settings).\n  - Why it matters: Different tree policies can affect counting; clarity is needed for consistent measurement.\n  - Evidence: The entropy-based “hard/easy token” categorization (Figure 3) lacks a precise formula and whether entropy is computed from the draft or target distributions.\n  - Why it matters: Reproducing the accuracy/divergence analysis requires these details; technical clarity would improve.\n- Bolded title: Internal consistency issues in speedup definitions, baselines, and reporting\n  - Evidence: Equation 1 in Section 3.2.2 labels T_avg^sd/T_t as “speedup,” while this quantity is a normalized latency ratio; additionally, the variable d appears but is not defined in the surrounding text, whereas K is used for block size in Algorithm 1 (Section 3.2.1).\n  - Why it matters: Terminology and notation ambiguities in the core analysis hinder interpretability and correct reasoning about improvements.\n  - Evidence: Table 2’s caption states speedup is measured relative to naive autoregressive generation; Figure 5 presents “speedup comparison” and its values match Table 2; the Abstract and Section 4.4.1 also state “up to 2.84×” and “2.84× speedup over the standard setting,” respectively.\n  - Why it matters: Mixing baselines (vs AR vs standard speculative decoding) across text, tables, and figures can mislead comparisons and complicate assessing practical gains.\n  - Evidence: Table 2 reports identical tokens/s across distinct target configurations at several lengths (e.g., GovReport 1K “No”: 100.31 Tok/s for both Vicuna-7B/Vicuna-68M and LongChat-7B/LongChat-68M; GovReport 16K “No”: 16.56 Tok/s for both, while speedups differ at 16K: 1.38× vs 1.51×).\n  - Why it matters: Apparent reporting inconsistencies reduce confidence in comparative results and make verification difficult.\n  - Evidence: Section 4.1.2 (Decoding) states “even falling below EAGLE-1 (Table 6),” but Table 6 contains results for EAGLE and EAGLE-3 only.\n  - Why it matters: Unsupported claims weaken credibility and should be aligned with available evidence.\n  - Evidence: Appendix A.2 refers to “parameters described in Section 5,” but Section 5 is the Conclusion; retrieval parameter details appear in Section 4.3.2 (Table 5).\n  - Why it matters: Misreferences impede reproducibility by sending readers to the wrong section.\n  - Evidence: Section 3.2.1 states attention scores are obtained with “no additional forward passes,” yet also notes computing standard attention to extract final-layer scores due to FlashDecoding; Table 8 shows a small “Target Forward w/ Retrieval” overhead.\n  - Why it matters: Ambiguity about computation changes in verification may lead to misunderstandings about overhead and implementation requirements.Suggestions for Improvement\n- Bolded title: Add comprehensive output quality evaluations alongside speed\n  - Recommendation: For long summarization, report ROUGE/BERTScore and, if feasible, human ratings, comparing Standard vs SpecExtend across input lengths (Table 2; Figure 5) to validate that speedups preserve quality.\n  - Recommendation: For long reasoning (AIME-24), include pass@1 or accuracy metrics with identical generation settings (Figure 6; Section 4.1.2) to demonstrate correctness retention under SpecExtend.\n  - Recommendation: Empirically validate “lossless” behavior by checking bitwise equivalence (or distributional equivalence under fixed seeds) between Standard and SpecExtend outputs on held-out inputs, especially when HTA is enabled (Section 3.1) and final-layer attention is used for retrieval (Section 3.2.1).\n- Bolded title: Provide fuller methodological detail for CMR and attention extraction\n  - Recommendation: Specify how SELECTCHUNKS aggregates attention over heads/layers, handles overlapping chunks, and updates cache indices (Algorithm 1; Section 3.2.1) to ensure reproducible implementations.\n  - Recommendation: Justify the use of final-layer attention with a small study comparing retrieval using different layers/aggregations, reporting its effect on τ and divergence (Table 8 for overhead;

Appendix A.2).\n  - Recommendation: Evaluate compatibility in different serving stacks where attention scores may not be readily available from optimized kernels; measure overhead of the fallback (Section 3.2.1) across runtimes.\n  - Recommendation: Include experiments with larger targets (e.g., ≥30B/70B) and different draft ratios to assess how SpecExtend scales (Table 2, Table 6) and whether overheads remain minimal (Table 8).\n- Bolded title: Deepen theoretical analysis beyond prior speedup formula\n  - Recommendation: Develop a simple analytical model linking working cache size, chunk size, top-k, and retrieval frequency (Table 5) to expected τ and Td, yielding guidance for parameter selection.\n  - Recommendation: Quantify the trade-off between retrieval overhead (Table 8) and τ improvement in closed form or via asymptotic bounds, and validate with measured breakdowns (Figure 4b).\n  - Recommendation: Provide a bound or probabilistic analysis on how target-guided retrieval affects divergence (Figure 3) and acceptance rates, possibly under assumptions about attention concentration.\n- Bolded title: Expand and document baseline configurations for fairness\n  - Recommendation: Detail hyperparameters and optimization settings for TriForce, MagicDec, and FlashDecoding (Section 4.2; Table 3), and consider consulting authors’ recommended configs to avoid under-optimization.\n  - Recommendation: Include reference comparisons to LongSpec (Section 2), even if training-based, documenting the training cost vs runtime benefit trade-off to situate SpecExtend.\n  - Recommendation: Add more non-training eviction baselines beyond StreamingLLM (e.g., fixed sliding window or heuristic relevance scoring), and compare their τ/tokens/s to CMR on the same datasets and lengths.\n- Bolded title: Improve clarity of datasets, metrics, and analysis reproducibility\n  - Recommendation: Precisely describe preprocessing (tokenization, truncation, segmentation) for GovReport/PG-19/BookSum inputs at each length, and publish input IDs used per run (Appendix A.2).\n  - Recommendation: Define τ calculation for tree-based speculative decoding (e.g., per target step average accepted tokens across branches) and ensure consistency across frameworks (Table 2; Figure 4a).\n  - Recommendation: Formalize the entropy computation (draft vs target distribution, window size) and the natural divergence formula used (Figure 3), and include code snippets or equations to enable reproduction.\n- Bolded title: Clarify and correct theoretical definitions and empirical baselines/reporting\n  - Recommendation: In Section 3.2.2, clearly define all variables in Equation 1 (e.g., d) and reconcile notation with Algorithm 1 (K);
