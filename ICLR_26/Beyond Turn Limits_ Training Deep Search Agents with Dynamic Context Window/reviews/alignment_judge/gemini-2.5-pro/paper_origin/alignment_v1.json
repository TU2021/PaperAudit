          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same two core contributions (hard data generation and a dynamic context window) and agree that the strong empirical results are a key strength. Review A, informed by the rebuttal, also highlights added ablations and reproducibility, points which are naturally absent from Review B's initial assessment.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews strongly align on two central weaknesses: the lack of detailed ablations (especially on window parameters) and the coarse, trajectory-level credit assignment. Review B places more emphasis on the LLM judge and data release, while Review A mentions the 'discard vs summarize' debate and training instability.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment, agreeing on the paper's core value (a novel two-pronged approach with strong results) and its main technical flaws (missing ablations, weak credit assignment). Differences in emphasis are largely explained by Review A having access to rebuttal information, which resolved some of the initial concerns flagged by Review B."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same two core contributions (reverse-constructed data and dynamic context window) and highlight the same primary strengths, namely the strong empirical results and the well-motivated approach to a real-world bottleneck. Review B provides much greater detail, but the substance and priorities are nearly identical to Review A's.",
          "weakness": "There is clear overlap on several major weaknesses, including the lack of ablations, concerns about the coarse reward signal, and the risks of dropping tool outputs without sufficient evidence. However, Review B identifies multiple additional major critiques absent from Review A, such as issues with evaluation comparability and dataset transparency, resulting in only a moderate alignment.",
          "overall": "The reviews are highly aligned on the paper's core contributions and strengths, but diverge on the breadth of weaknesses, with Review B being far more comprehensive. Despite this gap, both reviews convey a consistent overall judgment: the paper presents a promising method with strong results but requires more rigorous analysis and ablation to fully validate its claims."

          "strength": "Both reviews identify the same core strengths: the novel dynamic context management, the reverse-constructed dataset, and the strong empirical results. Review B provides much greater detail and adds a minor point on RL integration, but the primary contributions and their importance are almost perfectly aligned.",
          "weakness": "Both reviews identify the lack of ablations, concerns about the binary reward, and the risk of dropping tool outputs as key weaknesses. However, Review B introduces several additional major critiques absent from Review A, including issues with evaluation fairness against baselines, lack of dataset transparency, and potential internal inconsistencies in the paper's formulas.",
          "overall": "The reviews show high alignment on the paper's strengths but only moderate alignment on its weaknesses, where the AI review is substantially more comprehensive. While both converge on a judgment of a promising method with execution flaws, the specific flaws they focus on only partially overlap, leading to a moderate overall match in substance."
