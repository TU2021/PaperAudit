Based on a critical review of the manuscript, several significant internal inconsistencies and reporting errors have been identified that affect the paper's scientific validity and trustworthiness.

### **Integrity and Consistency Risk Report**

**1. Major Contradiction in Ablation Study Results**

The primary proposed model, TWGTM, is shown to be significantly outperformed by one of its variants in the ablation study, which contradicts the paper's central claims about the model's effectiveness.

*   **Evidence:** In Table 4 ("Ablation studies of network components in our model", Block #31), "Variant 3 (w/ Mask2BBox)" is evaluated for the Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF) task. This variant achieves substantially better scores across all reported metrics compared to the main "TWGTM (Ours)" model:
    *   FID↓: **9.201** (Variant 3) vs. 10.393 (Ours)
    *   SSIM↑: **0.769** (Variant 3) vs. 0.721 (Ours)
    *   LPIPS↓: **0.225** (Variant 3) vs. 0.332 (Ours)
    *   DISTS↓: **0.174** (Variant 3) vs. 0.195 (Ours)
*   **Problem:** The text in the "Ablation Studies" section (Block #28) acknowledges this, stating that Variant 3 "shows significant metric improvements." However, the paper offers no justification for presenting the demonstrably inferior TWGTM as the main contribution for the VTOFF task. This raises critical questions about the paper's conclusions and the optimality of the proposed framework.

**2. Inconsistent and Erroneous Reporting of Quantitative Results**

There are clear errors in how quantitative results are presented, undermining the reliability of the comparisons.

*   **Evidence 1 (Incorrect Bolding):** In Table 2 ("Quantitative comparison of VTON results... on the DressCode dataset", Block #24), for the "Dresses" category, the LPIPS score of **0.062** for "Ours" is bolded, indicating it is the best result. However, this value is tied with CatVTON for the highest (i.e., worst) score among the four most recent methods.
*   **Evidence 2 (Unsupported Claim):** In the discussion of VTOFF results (Block #21), the text states that the model's low DISTS score "aligns with its designation as the primary metric for VTOFF." The manuscript provides no prior justification, citation, or evidence to support the claim that DISTS is the "primary metric" for this task. This appears to be an ad-hoc justification to emphasize a favorable result.

**3. Contradiction Between Figure Caption and Content**

A figure caption explicitly misrepresents the content of the figure, leading to confusion.

*   **Evidence:** The caption for Figure 4 (Block #26) reads: "Qualitative comparison of VTON results with baselines." However, the corresponding text in the "Qualitative Comparison" section (Block #22) and the visual content of the figure itself (Block #30, showing dressed persons being converted to flattened garments) clearly pertain to the **VTOFF** task.

**4. Missing Figure Essential for Methodological Clarity**

A key part of the methodology is described with reference to a figure component that is absent from the manuscript.

*   **Evidence:** The "Processing in Latent Space" section (Block #9) heavily relies on "Figure 2(a)" to explain the crucial feature concatenation process for VTON and VTOFF. The caption for Figure 2 (Block #8) also lists part (a). However, only parts (b) and (c) of Figure 2 are provided (Blocks #11 and #10, respectively). The absence of Figure 2(a) makes it impossible to fully understand or verify a core mechanism of the proposed method.

**5. Overstated Claims Based on Weak Visual Evidence**

The manuscript draws a strong conclusion about the mutual benefits of joint training that is not adequately supported by the provided data.

*   **Evidence:** In the "Ablation Studies" section (Block #37), the authors claim that Figures 7 and 8 "substantiate our hypothesis that, to a certain extent, these two tasks can mutually enhance each other's performance."
    *   An inspection of Figure 7 (Block #38) shows that fine-tuning VTON leads to a *worse* DISTS score for VTOFF.
    *   An inspection of Figure 8 (Block #39) shows that fine-tuning VTOFF leads to negligible or fluctuating changes in VTON metrics, not a clear improvement.
*   **Problem:** The visual evidence is weak and contradictory, and does not robustly support the strong claim of mutual performance enhancement.

### **Conclusion**

The manuscript contains several high-impact inconsistencies, including a major contradiction where a variant in the ablation study significantly outperforms the proposed model, erroneous reporting in tables and figure captions, and claims that are not well-supported by the provided evidence. These issues materially affect the paper's correctness and trustworthiness and must be addressed before the work can be considered scientifically sound.
