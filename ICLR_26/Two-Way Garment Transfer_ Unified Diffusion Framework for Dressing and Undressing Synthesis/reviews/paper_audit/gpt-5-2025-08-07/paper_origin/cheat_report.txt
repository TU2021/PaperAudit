Academic integrity and internal consistency risk report

Summary of major, evidence-based issues detected

1) Contradictory task labeling in qualitative results (VTON vs VTOFF)
- The text states “For VTOFF, as shown in Figure 4…” (Section: Experiments, Block #22), but the caption of Figure 4 reads “Qualitative comparison of VTON results with baselines.” (Block #26).
- The image associated with Figure 4 (Block #30) shows reconstructed flat garment images for TryOffDiff, TryOffAnyone, and Ours, which is characteristic of VTOFF, not VTON.
- The text table immediately under the caption in Block #26 describes “Red crop top on person,” “Floral top on person,” etc., i.e., VTON outputs, which contradicts the actual image content (Block #30) that displays VTOFF outputs. This creates a clear internal inconsistency between description, caption, and visual content for Figure 4.

2) Conflicting description of Figure 6 (VTOFF ablations)
- The manuscript says “Figure 6 shows generated outcomes of ablation variants in VTOFF. The figure displays… Each row shows different clothing items being tried on different models.” (Block #32). “Tried on different models” refers to VTON, not VTOFF.
- The image associated with the VTOFF ablation (Block #40) shows flat garments, consistent with VTOFF, contradicting the text description in Block #32. This mismatch undermines clarity about which task the ablation visuals represent.

3) Figure numbering and placement inconsistencies
- Figure 1 is introduced in the Introduction with two parts: (a) weight similarity curve and (b) cross-task cosine similarity heatmap (Blocks #3–#4). The curve (Block #6) and heatmap (Block #7) exist, but the heatmap is placed under Method (Block #7), not Introduction, while being referenced as Figure 1(b). This is a placement/numbering inconsistency.
- Figure 2 is described with parts (a) latent-space input processing, (b) model overview, and (c) Extended Attention Module (Block #8). Images exist for (b) and (c) (Blocks #11 and #10), but Figure 2(a) is referenced and not provided. No direct evidence found in the manuscript for Figure 2(a).

4) Ambiguous or internally inconsistent resolution statements in the Spatial Refinement/TaskFormer output
- The TaskFormer section states: “The TaskFormer eventually outputs three-scale features with the same resolution as the UNet’s latent space.” (Section: Method, Block #15). Earlier, H is defined at three distinct scales (1/4, 1/8, 1/16). Saying “three-scale features” and “with the same resolution as the UNet’s latent space” is internally inconsistent: either outputs are multi-resolution (three distinct scales) or unified to a single resolution matching the UNet latent space. This ambiguity affects understanding of how F_SRM aligns dimensionally with UNet features.

5) Incomplete/malformed methodological text affecting mask handling reproducibility
- In latent-space inference, the manuscript says “For VTOFF, the original garment mask in h_m is substituted with an all-zeros mask.” (Section: Method, Block #9). Immediately after, there is a malformed fragment: “mask zeros(M) matching M’s dimensions…” (Section: Method, Block #12). This truncated sentence leaves unclear whether zeros(M) is intended to match M or describes a distinct operation, and how guidance features are adjusted. Given the centrality of mask conditioning in training and inference, this incomplete description is a material reproducibility risk.

6) Caption/content mismatch and duplication of task labels across figures
- Figure 3 is correctly labeled for VTON (Block #21, Block #23). Figure 4 is mislabeled as VTON while intended for VTOFF (Blocks #22, #26, #30).
- Figures 5 and 6 are ablations; Figure 5 shows VTON outputs (Block #27, Block #29), and Figure 6 shows VTOFF outputs (Block #40). However, the text description of Figure 6 (Block #32) refers to “being tried on different models,” contradicting the actual VTOFF visuals. These repeated caption/content mismatches reduce confidence in which qualitative evidence supports which claims.

7) Claims vs presented ablation results for the main metric in VTOFF
- The manuscript claims “our method… achieves the lowest DISTS score” among baselines for VTOFF (Block #21). Table 3 confirms Ours is best vs baselines (DISTS = 0.195) (Block #25).
- However, ablation Variant 3 achieves better DISTS (0.174) than Ours (0.195) (Table 4, Block #31). While ablations are not baselines, the paper positions DISTS as the primary metric for VTOFF (Block #21). The decision not to adopt the proven-better masking strategy (Variant 3) in the main model is not discussed, which leaves unexplained why a better-performing configuration was not used as the final approach. This omission weakens the justification of the chosen design.

8) Missing experimental details declared to be in the appendix
- Evaluation metrics and certain methodological aspects are said to be detailed “in the appendix” (Block #19), but no appendix is provided. No direct evidence found in the manuscript. This hinders verification of metric computation protocols (e.g., CLIP-FID, DINO similarity) and may affect the trustworthiness of reported comparisons.

9) Minor but notable consistency issues
- The caption under Table 1 states “The best and suboptimal results are demonstrated in bold and underlined, respectively.” (Block #21). Underlining is not visible in the provided table. This does not affect correctness but indicates presentation inconsistency.
- Inconsistent naming of a baseline method: “TryOffAnyOne” (Block #22) versus “TryOffAnyone” (Blocks #21, #41). While minor, it may cause confusion about which method is being compared.

Assessment

The most significant integrity risks stem from contradictory figure captions and descriptions (especially Figure 4 and Figure 6), missing/relocated figure components (Figure 2(a)), and incomplete mask-handling description (Block #12), all of which materially impede validation of claims and reproducibility. Additionally, the unresolved choice to not adopt a clearly superior ablation configuration for the primary VTOFF metric warrants an explicit justification.

Actionable recommendations

- Correct all figure captions and textual references to align tasks (VTON vs VTOFF) with the actual visual content. Specifically address Figure 4 (Blocks #22, #26, #30) and Figure 6 (Blocks #32, #40).
- Provide the missing Figure 2(a) or remove references to it and clarify the latent-space input processing pipeline in text.
- Clarify the TaskFormer output resolutions: specify whether outputs are multi-scale, how each scale is projected, and which resolution is fed into the UNet at each stage. Align this with the Decoder description (Block #15–#16).
- Fix the truncated sentence in Block #12 and fully specify mask generation/usage for both training stages and inference, including exact tensor shapes, whether masks are concatenated or encoded, and how they interact with h_m and guidance features in VTON and VTOFF.
- Explain why Variant 3 (Mask2BBox) is not adopted in the main model despite superior DISTS, and discuss trade-offs (e.g., controllability vs generality) to justify the chosen default.
- Include the referenced appendix or integrate those details in the main text to document metric computation settings, data splits, and implementation specifics necessary to reproduce results.

If these issues are resolved, the manuscript’s technical contributions could be more reliably evaluated. As it stands, the inconsistencies and missing details are significant enough to question the correctness and trustworthiness of the reported findings.
