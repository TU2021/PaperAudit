Summary
- The paper proposes TWGTM, a unified diffusion framework that addresses both mask-guided virtual try-on (VTON) and mask-free virtual try-off (VTOFF). The method couples dual-space conditioning: (i) latent-space spatial concatenation that reverses feature order to flip tasks (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space; Figure 2(a)) and (ii) pixel-space guidance via a Semantic Abstraction Module (CLIP+QFormer; Eqs. (3)–(4)) and a Spatial Refinement Module with TaskFormer (Eqs. (5)–(12)). An Extended Attention Block fuses these streams with UNet features using a zero-initialized linear modulation (Eq. (13); Figure 2(c)). A two-stage training schedule bridges mask asymmetry between tasks with auxiliary mask prediction for VTOFF (Eqs. (14)–(16)). Experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode show competitive or state-of-the-art results for VTON (Tables 1–2; Figure 3) and VTOFF (Table 3; Figure 4), with ablations (Table 4; Figures 5–6) and cross-task fine-tuning analyses (Figures 7–8).Strengths
- Bolded title: Unified two-way formulation with empirical task commonality
  - The paper motivates VTON/VTOFF duality via architectural/feature similarities and layer-wise output correlations (Introduction, Figure 1(a)-(b)), supporting the premise that reversing feature concatenation order can invert the task objective (Introduction, Block #4). This matters for novelty and design parsimony.
  - The latent-space construction explicitly reverses the spatial order of [x, c] between VTON and VTOFF (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space), making the bidirectional mapping operational rather than conceptual. This contributes to clarity and technical soundness.
  - The training/inference pipeline preserves the same conditioning channels while switching/noising inputs appropriately (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space; “Inference Phase”), enhancing a single model’s usability across tasks.- Bolded title: Dual-space conditioning that blends semantics and spatial detail
  - The Semantic Abstraction Module combines frozen CLIP with QFormer to extract category-aware garment semantics (Eqs. (3)–(4)), which improves high-level conditioning without overfitting; this is technically sound and leverages strong vision-language priors.
  - The Spatial Refinement Module (Swin features H1–H3; TaskFormer with masked attention; Eqs. (5)–(11)) targets fine-grained spatial detail and region-specific refinement, addressing texture/shape preservation (Method: Spatial Refinement Module).
  - The Extended Attention Block fuses UNet self-attention with spatial features under a zero-linear modulation to stabilize training (Figure 2(c); Eq. (13)), an architectural contribution that improves integration of pixel-space cues.- Bolded title: Phased training to reconcile mask asymmetry across tasks
  - Stage 1: VTOFF learns inpainting with a predicted flattened garment mask and auxiliary mask loss (Eqs. (14)–(15)), enabling shape inference when explicit masks are unavailable (Training Strategy).
  - Stage 2: Morphological operations create square masks to strengthen shape awareness while activating Extended Attention for better spatial constraints (Eq. (16); Training Strategy). This is a principled curriculum to handle increasing difficulty.
  - The inference protocol removes the garment mask for VTOFF to simulate mask-free settings while retaining guidance channels (Preliminaries: “Inference Phase”), ensuring consistency with the task’s requirements.- Bolded title: Strong empirical results across tasks and datasets
  - VTON on VITON-HD: competitive/best metrics (e.g., SSIM 0.905, LPIPS 0.055) in Table 1; qualitative preservation of fine details (Figure 3). This indicates effectiveness on standard benchmarks.
  - VTON on DressCode: best SSIM on all categories and competitive FID (Table 2), demonstrating generalization to multi-category settings.
  - VTOFF on VITON-HD: state-of-the-art on most metrics (lowest DISTS 0.195; best KID 1.5; Table 3), supporting the unified framework’s strength for the inverse task.- Bolded title: Thorough ablation and component analysis
  - Variants removing SRM or QFormer degrade performance (Table 4, “Variant 1/8”), directly attributing gains to the proposed pixel-space modules—good experimental rigor.
  - Alternative fusion designs (pre-self-attention concat; IP-Adapter) underperform (Table 4, “Variant 6/7”), validating the Extended Attention design choice (Figure 2(c)).
  - Warping-based fusion (Variant 2) slightly improves SSIM but introduces artifacts (Table 4; Figures 5–6), arguing for latent spatial concatenation as a robust strategy.- Bolded title: Cross-task transfer effects support the unified view
  - Fine-tuning one task improves the other task’s metrics (Figures 7–8; Experiments, Block #37), empirically supporting the hypothesis of shared deformation modeling—this bolsters impact and conceptual soundness.- Bolded title: Clear mathematical and system specification where provided
  - The diffusion objective and conditioning are clearly formalized (Eqs. (1)–(2), (14)–(16)).
  - The explicit construction of the latent inputs I_t, masks, and concatenations (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space) improves reproducibility and clarity.
  - The SRM outputs, mask projections, and query-specific task outputs (Eqs. (8)–(12)) provide a precise mapping from modules to signals.Weaknesses
- Bolded title: Lack of formal definition/validation of the “implicit unified deformation field” and scope of novelty
  - Although the paper claims bidirectional derivation via an implicit unified deformation field (Abstract; Introduction, contribution bullets), there is no explicit formulation or estimation of such a field in the method section—no equation or visualization of the field itself. Why it matters: technical clarity and novelty boundaries. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript beyond descriptive claims.
  - The cross-task similarity analysis (Figure 1) motivates shared representations but does not quantify or visualize a learned forward/inverse deformation map tying the two tasks (Introduction; Figure 1). Why it matters: validating the core conceptual claim.
  - The “first unified framework” claim (Abstract; Introduction) is not substantiated by a survey of prior two-way or multi-task designs; the Related Work does not explicitly rule out prior unified formulations. Why it matters: novelty positioning. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.- Bolded title: Incomplete specification of VTOFF mask supervision and TaskFormer details
  - Stage-1 “auxiliary segmentation loss for canonical garment shapes” (Introduction, contributions; Training Strategy, Eq. (15)) lacks details on how canonical masks/labels are obtained from datasets that do not provide such annotations (VITON-HD/DressCode descriptions in Datasets and Metrics omit canonical mask availability). Why it matters: reproducibility and fairness. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Hyperparameters for the mask loss (λ, λ′, λ′′ in Eqs. (14)–(15)) are unspecified, as are thresholds and training settings for TFQ_0 (Eq. (10)). Why it matters: experimental rigor and reproducibility. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Morphological operations (Stage 2) are described but kernel sizes, iterations, and structuring elements are not reported (Training Strategy; Eq. (16)). Why it matters: reproducibility and effect isolation. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - There is a training–inference mismatch: Stage-2 trains with square masks, but VTOFF inference uses an all-zero mask in h_m (Preliminaries: “Inference Phase”; Training Strategy). Why it matters: potential performance gap and unclear robustness.- Bolded title: Limited baselines and datasets for VTOFF evaluation
  - Table 3 compares only with TryOffDiff and TryOffAnyone on VITON-HD, omitting other contemporary methods referenced in Related Work (e.g., broader diffusion-based fashion reconstruction if any). Why it matters: strength of SOTA claims.
  - VTOFF is not evaluated on DressCode, even though DressCode’s multi-category nature could test generalization (Datasets and Metrics; contrast with VTON Tables 1–2). Why it matters: robustness and external validity.
  - No user or perceptual study is included to validate garment fidelity, shape correctness, and color consistency for VTOFF (Qualitative Comparison; Table 3 focuses on automated metrics). Why it matters: alignment with human perception.- Bolded title: Missing experimental details impede reproducibility
  - Training specifics (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, augmentation, number of steps/epochs) are not provided (Experiments sections). Why it matters: reproducibility. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Compute budget, inference speed, number of diffusion steps, and memory/parameter counts are not reported (Method/Experiments). Why it matters: practicality and deployment. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Dataset splits and seed control are not specified (Datasets and Metrics) beyond stating the datasets and metrics. Why it matters: comparability and variance control. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Code/model release plans are not discussed. Why it matters: verifiability. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.- Bolded title: Clarity and consistency issues in figures and notation
  - Figure 4 is referred to for VTOFF qualitative results (Experiments: “For VTOFF, as shown in Figure 4”), but the caption reads “Qualitative comparison of VTON results with baselines,” which is inconsistent with the text (Figure 4 caption vs. Section “Qualitative Comparison”). Why it matters: clarity.
  - Figure 2(a)-(c) are referenced, but only parts of the composite figure are visible, and it is unclear how “latent space input processing” (2a) aligns with the exact tensors in the UNet (Figure 2(b)-(c); Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space). Why it matters: clarity of pipeline mapping.
  - In Eq. (12), TFQ is used as input to the Decoder, yet the precise dimensions of TFQ across scales after Eqs. (8)–(11) are not fully specified, making integration with the UNet less transparent (Method: Spatial Refinement Module). Why it matters: technical clarity.
  - Some textual references are imprecise, e.g., “More details can be found in the appendix” for metric protocols and DressCode analysis (Datasets and Metrics; Quantitative Comparison) without accessible details here. Why it matters: completeness.- Bolded title: Evaluation methodology leaves confounds unaddressed
  - The DressCode shortfall is attributed to lighting-induced color inconsistencies (“we speculate” in Quantitative Comparison), but no controlled study isolates lighting/illumination effects. Why it matters: diagnostic rigor. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript beyond speculation.
  - The paper designates DISTS as a primary metric for VTOFF (Experiments: Quantitative Comparison for VTOFF), but does not provide justification via human correlation or task-specific validation. Why it matters: metric appropriateness.
  - Trade-offs across metrics (e.g., VITON-HD: Ours FID 6.107 vs. CatVTON 5.693; Table 1) are not analyzed to understand perceptual versus structural differences; no calibration of FID/CLIP-FID across tasks. Why it matters: interpretation of results.Suggestions for Improvement
- Bolded title: Formalize and validate the “unified deformation field” and refine novelty positioning
  - Provide an explicit definition and learning objective for the forward/inverse deformation fields, or an equivalent latent warping operator, with equations and training signals tying VTON and VTOFF (responding to Abstract; Introduction).
  - Add visualizations/metrics that quantify consistency or invertibility across the two directions (e.g., cycle consistency on feature maps), complementing Figure 1’s similarity analysis.
  - Strengthen the “first unified” claim by expanding Related Work with a focused discussion of multi-task/two-way frameworks and clarifying scope and differences (Related Work).- Bolded title: Specify VTOFF mask supervision and TaskFormer training details comprehensively
  - Describe how “canonical garment masks” are obtained (auto-segmentation pipeline, thresholds, post-processing) and how they map to Eq. (15) losses, including dataset sources (Datasets and Metrics; Training Strategy).
  - Report the exact values for λ, λ′, λ′′ (Eqs. (14)–(15)), TFQ_0 training settings (Eq. (10)), and any thresholds or temperature parameters used.
  - Detail morphological operation settings (kernel type/size, iterations) for Stage 2 (Eq. (16)), and provide a sensitivity analysis.
  - Address the training–inference mismatch by either (i) training with the all-zero mask regime as well, or (ii) adding a curriculum that mixes mask shapes and includes mask-free steps; report an ablation revealing the impact (Preliminaries: “Inference Phase”).- Bolded title: Broaden VTOFF evaluation and baselines
  - Include more VTOFF baselines where feasible (especially those referenced in Related Work) on VITON-HD to strengthen SOTA claims (Table 3).
  - Evaluate VTOFF on DressCode to test category robustness and cross-domain generalization (Datasets and Metrics).

  - Expand Figure 2 to explicitly show the tensor flows and dimensions from I_t (Preliminaries) through UNet blocks and Extended Attention (Figure 2(b)-(c)), clarifying the role of each channel.
  - Add tensor shape annotations to Eqs. (8)–(12) and specify how multi-scale TFQ aligns with UNet resolutions; detail Decoder architecture (Method: Spatial Refinement Module).
  - Where the text points to “appendix” for crucial evaluation details (Datasets and Metrics; Quantitative Comparison), pull essential content into the main paper or include a summary table for quick reference.- Bolded title: Strengthen evaluation methodology and analysis
  - Run controlled experiments for lighting/illumination discrepancies on DressCode (e.g., equalized/normalized color spaces) to test the speculation in Quantitative Comparison; include before/after metrics.
  - Justify DISTS as a primary VTOFF metric by providing correlation with a user study or by analyzing its sensitivity to texture/structure in this task (Table 3).
  - Discuss and analyze metric trade-offs (e.g., FID vs. SSIM/LPIPS in Table 1) and provide qualitative exemplars that explain why FID may be slightly worse while SSIM/LPIPS improve.Score
- Overall (10): 7 — Unified two-way design with dual-space conditioning and phased training shows strong VTON/VTOFF results and ablations (Tables 1–4; Figures 3–6), but lacks formalization of the “unified deformation field” and some key experimental details (Abstract; Training Strategy; Preliminaries).
- Novelty (10): 6 — The bidirectional formulation and Extended Attention integration are interesting (Figure 2(c); Eqs. (3)–(13)), yet the claim of the first unified framework is not fully substantiated and the deformation-field concept remains informal (Abstract; Introduction; Figure 1).
- Technical Quality (10): 7 — Sound architecture and curriculum with extensive ablations and cross-task transfer (Table 4; Figures 5–8), tempered by missing details for VTOFF mask supervision and training hyperparameters (Eqs. (14)–(16); Experiments).
- Clarity (10): 6 — Clear mathematical components and pipeline overview (Eqs. (1)–(13); Figure 2(b)-(c)) but figure-caption inconsistencies and unspecified tensor shapes/appendix dependencies reduce readability (Figure 4 caption; Method: SRM/Decoder).
- Confidence (5): 3 — Assessment is based on provided results and figures (Tables 1–4; Figures 3–8), but missing implementation specifics and incomplete evaluation scope (e.g., VTOFF on DressCode) limit certainty.
