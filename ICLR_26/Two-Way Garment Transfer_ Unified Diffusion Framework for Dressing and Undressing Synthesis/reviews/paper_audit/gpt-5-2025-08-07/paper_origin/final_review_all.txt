Summary
- The paper proposes TWGTM, a unified diffusion framework for both mask-guided virtual try-on (VTON) and mask-free virtual try-off (VTOFF). The method combines dual-space conditioning: (i) latent-space spatial concatenation with reversed feature order to flip tasks (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space; Figure 2(b)) and (ii) pixel-space guidance via a Semantic Abstraction Module (CLIP+QFormer; Eqs. (3)–(4)) and a Spatial Refinement Module with TaskFormer (Eqs. (5)–(12)). An Extended Attention Block fuses these cues with UNet features via zero-linear modulation (Eq. (13); Figure 2(c)). A two-stage training schedule bridges mask asymmetry with auxiliary mask prediction for VTOFF (Eqs. (14)–(16)). Experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode report competitive or state-of-the-art results for VTON (Tables 1–2; Figure 3) and VTOFF (Table 3; Figure 4), with ablations (Table 4; Figures 5–6) and cross-task fine-tuning analyses (Figures 7–8).Strengths
- Bolded title: Unified two-way formulation with empirical task commonality
  - The paper motivates VTON/VTOFF duality via architectural/feature similarities and layer-wise output correlations (Introduction; Figure 1(a)–(b)), supporting the premise that reversing feature concatenation order can invert the task objective. This matters for novelty and design parsimony.
  - The latent-space construction explicitly reverses the spatial order of [x, c] between VTON and VTOFF (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space), making the bidirectional mapping operational rather than conceptual. This contributes to clarity and technical soundness.
  - The training/inference pipeline preserves the same conditioning channels while switching/noising inputs appropriately (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space; Inference Phase), enhancing a single model’s usability across tasks.
- Bolded title: Dual-space conditioning that blends semantics and spatial detail
  - The Semantic Abstraction Module combines frozen CLIP with QFormer to extract category-aware garment semantics (Eqs. (3)–(4)), which improves high-level conditioning; this leverages strong vision–language priors (technical soundness; potential impact).
  - The Spatial Refinement Module (Swin features H1–H3; TaskFormer with masked attention; Eqs. (5)–(11)) targets fine-grained spatial detail and region-specific refinement, addressing texture/shape preservation (Method: Spatial Refinement Module), which is important for fidelity.
  - The Extended Attention Block fuses UNet self-attention with spatial features under a zero-linear modulation that gradually introduces spatial influences and suppresses noise (Figure 2(c); Eq. (13); Method: Extended Attention Block), an architectural contribution for integrating pixel-space cues (technical soundness; clarity).
- Bolded title: Phased training to reconcile mask asymmetry across tasks
  - Stage 1: VTOFF learns inpainting with a predicted flattened garment mask and auxiliary mask loss (Eqs. (14)–(15)), enabling shape inference when explicit masks are unavailable (Training Strategy). This is relevant to feasibility.
  - Stage 2: Morphological operations create square masks to strengthen shape awareness while activating Extended Attention for better spatial constraints (Eq. (16); Training Strategy). This is a principled curriculum to handle increasing difficulty, supporting technical soundness.
  - The inference protocol removes the garment mask for VTOFF to simulate mask-free settings while retaining guidance channels (Preliminaries: Inference Phase), ensuring consistency with task requirements (clarity; robustness).
- Bolded title: Strong empirical results across tasks and datasets
  - VTON on VITON-HD: competitive/best metrics (e.g., SSIM 0.905, LPIPS 0.055) in Table 1; qualitative preservation of fine details (Figure 3). This indicates effectiveness on standard benchmarks (impact).
  - VTON on DressCode: best SSIM across categories and competitive/best FID depending on category (Table 2), demonstrating generalization to multi-category settings (robustness; impact).
  - VTOFF on VITON-HD: state-of-the-art on most metrics (lowest DISTS 0.195; best KID 1.5; Table 3), supporting the unified framework’s strength for the inverse task (impact).
- Bolded title: Thorough ablation and component analysis
  - Variants removing SRM or QFormer degrade performance (Table 4, “Variant 1/8”), directly attributing gains to the proposed pixel-space modules—good experimental rigor.
  - Alternative fusion designs (pre-self-attention concat; IP-Adapter) underperform (Table 4, “Variant 6/7”), validating the Extended Attention design choice (Figure 2(c); technical soundness).
  - Warping-based fusion (Variant 2) slightly improves SSIM but introduces artifacts (Table 4; Figures 5–6), arguing for latent spatial concatenation as a robust strategy (clarity of design trade-offs; impact).
- Bolded title: Cross-task transfer effects support the unified view
  - Fine-tuning one task improves the other task’s metrics (Figures 7–8; Experiments), empirically supporting the hypothesis of shared deformation modeling—this bolsters impact and conceptual soundness.
- Bolded title: Clear mathematical and system specification where provided
  - The diffusion objective and conditioning are clearly formalized (Eqs. (1)–(2), (14)–(16)), aiding reproducibility.
  - The explicit construction of the latent inputs I_t, masks, and concatenations (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space) improves clarity and reimplementation prospects.
  - The SRM outputs, mask projections, and query-specific task outputs (Eqs. (8)–(12)) provide a mapping from modules to signals (technical clarity).Weaknesses
- Bolded title: Lack of formal definition/validation of the “implicit unified deformation field” and scope of novelty
  - Although the paper claims bidirectional derivation via an implicit unified deformation field (Abstract; Introduction, contributions), there is no explicit formulation or estimation of such a field in the method section—no equation or visualization of the field itself. Why it matters: technical clarity and novelty boundaries. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript beyond descriptive claims.
  - The cross-task similarity analysis (Figure 1) motivates shared representations but does not quantify or visualize a learned forward/inverse deformation map tying the two tasks (Introduction; Figure 1). Why it matters: validating the core conceptual claim.
  - The “first unified framework” claim (Abstract; Introduction) is not substantiated by a survey of prior two-way or multi-task designs; the Related Work does not explicitly rule out prior unified formulations. Why it matters: novelty positioning. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
- Bolded title: Incomplete specification of VTOFF mask supervision and TaskFormer details
  - Stage-1 “auxiliary segmentation loss for canonical garment shapes” (Introduction; Training Strategy, Eq. (15)) lacks details on how canonical masks/labels are obtained from datasets that do not provide such annotations (Datasets and Metrics do not mention canonical mask availability). Why it matters: reproducibility and fairness. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Hyperparameters for the mask loss (λ, λ′, λ′′ in Eqs. (14)–(15)) are unspecified, as are thresholds and training settings for TFQ_0 (Eq. (10)). Why it matters: experimental rigor and reproducibility. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Morphological operations (Stage 2) are described but kernel sizes, iterations, and structuring elements are not reported (Training Strategy; Eq. (16)). Why it matters: reproducibility and effect isolation. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - There is a training–inference mismatch: Stage-2 trains with square masks, but VTOFF inference uses an all-zero mask in h_m (Preliminaries: Inference Phase; Training Strategy). Why it matters: potential performance gap and unclear robustness.
- Bolded title: Limited baselines and datasets for VTOFF evaluation
  - Table 3 compares only with TryOffDiff and TryOffAnyone on VITON-HD, omitting other contemporary methods referenced in Related Work (if applicable). Why it matters: strength of SOTA claims (Table 3; Related Work).
  - VTOFF is not evaluated on DressCode, even though DressCode’s multi-category nature could test generalization (Datasets and Metrics; contrast with VTON Tables 1–2). Why it matters: robustness and external validity.
  - No user or perceptual study is included to validate garment fidelity, shape correctness, and color consistency for VTOFF (Qualitative Comparison; Table 3 focuses on automated metrics). Why it matters: alignment with human perception.
- Bolded title: Missing experimental details impede reproducibility
  - Training specifics (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, augmentation, number of steps/epochs) are not provided (Experiments sections). Why it matters: reproducibility. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Compute budget, inference speed, number of diffusion steps, and memory/parameter counts are not reported (Method/Experiments). Why it matters: practicality and deployment. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Dataset splits and seed control are not specified (Datasets and Metrics) beyond stating the datasets and metrics. Why it matters: comparability and variance control. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
  - Code/model release plans are not discussed. Why it matters: verifiability. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript.
- Bolded title: Clarity and consistency issues in figures and notation
  - Figure 4 is referred to for VTOFF qualitative results (Experiments: “For VTOFF, as shown in Figure 4”), but the caption reads “Qualitative comparison of VTON results with baselines,” while the visual content depicts VTOFF reconstruction of flat garments (Figure 4 caption; Figure 4 image; Section “Qualitative Comparison”). Why it matters: clarity and internal consistency.
  - Figure 2 references an (a) subfigure for latent-space input processing (Method: Figure 2 caption), but only (b)–(c) are provided (Figures 2(b)–(c)), and the mapping from “latent space input processing” to UNet tensors remains ambiguous (Method; Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space). Additionally, the text includes a truncated sentence on mask handling (“mask zeros(M)…”) leaving inference mask usage unclear (Method: text following Figure 2). Why it matters: clarity of pipeline and reproducibility.
  - In Eq. (12), TFQ is used as input to the Decoder, yet the precise dimensions of TFQ across scales after Eqs. (8)–(11) are not fully specified, and the statement “TaskFormer eventually outputs three-scale features with the same resolution as the UNet’s latent space” conflicts with earlier multi-scale definitions at 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 (Method: Spatial Refinement Module). Why it matters: technical clarity.
  - Some textual references are imprecise, e.g., “More details can be found in the appendix” for metric protocols and DressCode analysis (Datasets and Metrics; Quantitative Comparison) without accessible details here. Why it matters: completeness.
- Bolded title: Evaluation methodology leaves confounds unaddressed
  - The DressCode shortfall is attributed to lighting-induced color inconsistencies (“we speculate” in Quantitative Comparison), but no controlled study isolates lighting/illumination effects. Why it matters: diagnostic rigor. Evidence: No direct evidence found in the manuscript beyond speculation (Experiments: Quantitative Comparison).
  - The paper designates DISTS as a primary metric for VTOFF (Experiments: Quantitative Comparison; Table 3), but does not provide justification via human correlation or task-specific validation. Why it matters: metric appropriateness.
  - Trade-offs across metrics (e.g., VITON-HD: Ours FID 6.107 vs. CatVTON 5.693; Table 1) are not analyzed to understand perceptual versus structural differences; no calibration of FID/CLIP-FID across tasks. Why it matters: interpretation of results.
  - Ablation Variant 3 (Mask2BBox at inference) achieves better VTOFF DISTS (0.174) than the default model (0.195) but is not adopted as the main configuration, and the paper does not discuss trade-offs that justify the chosen default (Table 4; Figure 6). Why it matters: clarity of design choices and metric-driven justification.Suggestions for Improvement
- Bolded title: Formalize and validate the “unified deformation field” and refine novelty positioning
  - Provide an explicit definition and learning objective for the forward/inverse deformation fields, or an equivalent latent warping operator, with equations and training signals tying VTON and VTOFF (responding to Abstract; Introduction).
  - Add visualizations/metrics that quantify consistency or invertibility across the two directions (e.g., cycle consistency on feature maps), complementing Figure 1’s similarity analysis (Figure 1; Method/Experiments).
  - Strengthen the “first unified” claim by expanding Related Work with a focused discussion of multi-task/two-way frameworks and clarifying scope and differences (Related Work).
- Bolded title: Specify VTOFF mask supervision and TaskFormer training details comprehensively
  - Describe how “canonical garment masks” are obtained (auto-segmentation pipeline, thresholds, post-processing) and how they map to Eq. (15) losses, including dataset sources (Datasets and Metrics; Training Strategy).
  - Report the exact values for λ, λ′, λ′′ (Eqs. (14)–(15)), TFQ_0 training settings (Eq. (10)), and any thresholds or temperature parameters used.
  - Detail morphological operation settings (kernel type/size, iterations) for Stage 2 (Eq. (16)), and provide a sensitivity analysis (Training Strategy).
  - Address the training–inference mismatch by either (i) training with the all-zero mask regime as well, or (ii) adding a curriculum that mixes mask shapes and includes mask-free steps; report an ablation revealing the impact (Preliminaries: Inference Phase; Training Strategy).
- Bolded title: Broaden VTOFF evaluation and baselines
  - Include more VTOFF baselines where feasible (especially those referenced in Related Work) on VITON-HD to strengthen SOTA claims (Table 3).
  - Evaluate VTOFF on DressCode to test category robustness and cross-domain generalization (Datasets and Metrics).
  - Add a small-scale user study (pairwise preference for texture/shaping/color) to validate automated metrics and qualitative claims (Qualitative Comparison; Table 3).
- Bolded title: Provide missing experimental details to enable reproducibility
  - Report full training setups: optimizer, learning rate schedules, batch size, training steps/epochs, augmentations; include diffusion timesteps and noise schedules (Experiments; Preliminaries).
  - Provide compute resources (GPUs, hours), parameter counts per module (SAM/SRM/TaskFormer), inference speed (s/img), and VRAM usage (Method; Experiments).
  - Specify dataset splits, any filtering rules, and random seeds; report performance variance across seeds (Datasets and Metrics).
  - State plans for code/model release and include a detailed README with the latent/pixel conditioning construction (Preliminaries: Processing in Latent Space; Method).
- Bolded title: Improve figure/text consistency and technical notation precision
  - Correct Figure 4’s caption to match the text (VTOFF) and ensure all figures have self-contained, accurate captions (Experiments: Qualitative Comparison).
  - Expand Figure 2 to explicitly show the tensor flows and dimensions from I_t (Preliminaries) through UNet blocks and Extended Attention (Figure 2(b)–(c)), clarifying the role of each channel; also fix the truncated “mask zeros(M)” sentence and precisely specify mask handling in inference (Method: Figure 2 caption and adjacent text; Preliminaries: Inference Phase).
  - Add tensor shape annotations to Eqs. (8)–(12) and specify how multi-scale TFQ aligns with UNet resolutions; reconcile the multi-scale outputs with the claim of “same resolution” to eliminate ambiguity; detail Decoder architecture (Method: Spatial Refinement Module).
  - Where the text points to “appendix” for crucial evaluation details (Datasets and Metrics; Quantitative Comparison), pull essential content into the main paper or include a summary table for quick reference.
- Bolded title: Strengthen evaluation methodology and analysis
  - Run controlled experiments for lighting/illumination discrepancies on DressCode (e.g., equalized/normalized color spaces) to test the speculation in Quantitative Comparison; include before/after metrics (Experiments).
  - Justify DISTS as a primary VTOFF metric by providing correlation with a user study or by analyzing its sensitivity to texture/structure in this task (Table 3).
  - Discuss and analyze metric trade-offs (e.g., FID vs. SSIM/LPIPS in Table 1) and provide qualitative exemplars that explain why FID may be slightly worse while SSIM/LPIPS improve (Figures 3–4).
  - Explain and empirically compare the default VTOFF configuration against Variant 3 (Mask2BBox) that achieves a better DISTS (Table 4; Figure 6), including trade-offs (e.g., controllability vs. generality) to justify the chosen default.Score
- Overall (10): 7 — Unified two-way design with dual-space conditioning and phased training shows strong VTON/VTOFF results and ablations (Tables 1–4; Figures 3–6), but lacks formalization of the “unified deformation field” and some key experimental details (Abstract; Training Strategy; Preliminaries).
- Novelty (10): 6 — The bidirectional formulation and Extended Attention integration are interesting (Figure 2(c); Eqs. (3)–(13)), yet the claim of the first unified framework is not fully substantiated and the deformation-field concept remains informal (Abstract; Introduction; Figure 1).
- Technical Quality (10): 7 — Sound architecture and curriculum with extensive ablations and cross-task transfer (Table 4; Figures 5–8), tempered by missing details for VTOFF mask supervision and training hyperparameters (Eqs. (14)–(16); Experiments).
- Clarity (10): 6 — Clear mathematical components and pipeline overview (Eqs. (1)–(13); Figure 2(b)–(c)) but figure-caption inconsistencies, an incomplete mask-handling sentence, and unspecified tensor shapes/appendix dependencies reduce readability (Figure 4 caption; Method: SRM/Decoder; Experiments: Datasets and Metrics).
- Confidence (5): 3 — Assessment is based on provided results and figures (Tables 1–4; Figures 3–8), but missing implementation specifics and incomplete evaluation scope (e.g., VTOFF on DressCode) limit certainty.
